        <hr>
<div class="p-summary">
        <div>
<p>Almost three years ago, <a class="reference external" href="https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2014/09/budgetwarrior-041-expense-templates-and-year-projection.html">I published the version 0.4.1 of budgetwarrior</a>. Since then, I've been using this tool almost every day to manage my personal budget. This is the only tool I use to keep track of my expenses and earnings and it makes a great tool for me. I recently felt that it was missing a few features and added them and polished a few things as well and release a new version with all the new stuff. This new version is probably nothing fancy, but a nice upgrade of the tool.</p>
<p>Don't pay too much attention to the values in the images since I've randomized
all the data for the purpose of this post (new feature, by the way :P).</p>
<div class="section" id="new-summary-view">
<h2>New summary view</h2>
<p>I've added a new report with <code>budget summary</code>:</p>
<img alt="/images/budgetwarrior_042_summary.png" src="images/budgetwarrior_042_summary.png"><p>This view gives concise information about the current state of your accounts. It
also gives information about your yearly and monthly objectives. Finally, it
also gives information about the last two fortune values that you've set.
I think this make a great kind of dashboard to view most of the information. If
your terminal is large enough, the three parts will be shown side by side.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="improved-fortune-report">
<h2>Improved fortune report</h2>
<p>I've made a few improvements to the <code>budget fortune</code> view:</p>
<img alt="/images/budgetwarrior_042_fortune.png" src="images/budgetwarrior_042_fortune.png"><p>It now display the time between the different fortune values and it compute the
average savings (or avg losses) per day in each interval and in average from the
beginning of the first value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="various-changes">
<h2>Various changes</h2>
<p>The balance does not propagate over the years anymore. This should mainly change
the behaviour of <code>budget overview</code>. I don't think it was very
smart to propagate it all the time. The balance now starts at zero for each
year. If you want the old system, you can use the multi_year_balance=true option
in the .budgetrc configuration file.</p>
<p>The recurring expenses do not use an internal configuration value. This does not
change anything for the behaviour, but means that if you sync between different
machines, it will avoid a lot of possible conflicts :)</p>
<p>Fixed a few bugs with inconsistency between the different views and reports.
Another bug that was fixed is that <code>budget report</code> was not always displaying the
first month of the year correctly, this is now fixed.</p>
<p>The graphs display in <code>budget report</code> are now automatically adapted to width of
your terminal. Finally, the <code>budget overview</code> command also displays more
information about the comparison with the previous month.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installation">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>If you are on Gentoo, you can install it using layman:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
layman -a wichtounet
emerge -a budgetwarrior
</pre>
<p>If you are on Arch Linux, you can use this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/StreakyCobra/aur-budgetwarrior">AUR repository</a>.</p>
<p>For other systems, you'll have to install from sources:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git clone --recursive git://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior.git
cd budgetwarrior
make
sudo make install
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion-4">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A brief tutorial is available on Github: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior/wiki/Start-tutorial">Starting guide</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested by the sources, you can download them on Github:

<p>I've been recently reminded that a long time ago I was doing a series of
tutorial on C++11 Concurrency. For some reason, I haven't continued these
tutorials.  The next post in the series was supposed to be about Futures, so I'm
finally going to do it :)</p>

<p>In this post, we are going to talk about futures, more precisely
<code>std::future&lt;T&gt;</code>. What is a future ? It's a very nice and simple mechanism
to work with asynchronous tasks. It also has the advantage of decoupling you
from the threads themselves, you can do multithreading without using
<code>std::thread</code>. The future itself is a structure pointing to a result that
will be computed in the future. How to create a future ? The simplest way is to
use <code>std::async</code> that will create an asynchronous task and return
a <code>std::future</code>.</p>
<p>Let's start with the simplest of the examples:</p>

<p>Nothing really special here. <code>std::async</code> will execute the task that we
give it (here a lambda) and return a <code>std::future</code>. Once you use the
<code>get()</code> function on a future, it will wait until the result is available
and return this result to you once it is. The <code>get()</code> function is then
blocking. Since the lambda, is a void lambda, the returned future is of type
<code>std::future&lt;void&gt;</code> and <code>get()</code> returns <code>void</code> as well. It is
very important to know that you cannot call <code>get</code> several times on the
same future. Once the result is consumed, you cannot consume it again! If you
want to use the result several times, you need to store it yourself after you
called <code>get()</code>.</p>
<p>Let's see with something that returns a value and actually takes some time
before returning it:</p>

<p>This time, the future will be of the time <code>std::future&lt;int&gt;</code> and thus
<code>get()</code> will also return an <code>int</code>. <code>std::async</code> will again
launch a task in an asynchronous way and <code>future.get()</code> will wait for the
answer. What is interesting, is that you can do something else before the call
to future.</p>
<p>But <code>get()</code> is not the only interesting function in <code>std::future</code>.
You also have <code>wait()</code> which is almost the same as <code>get()</code> but does
not consume the result. For instance, you can wait for several futures and then
consume their result together. But, more interesting are the
<code>wait_for(duration)</code> and <code>wait_until(timepoint)</code> functions. The
first one wait for the result at most the given time and then returns and the
second one wait for the result at most until the given time point. I think that
<code>wait_for</code> is more useful in practices, so let's discuss it further.
Finally, an interesting function is <code>bool valid()</code>. When you use
<code>get()</code> on the future, it will consume the result, making <code>valid()
returns :code:`false</code>. So, if you intend to check multiple times for a future,
you should use <code>valid()</code> first.</p>
<p>One possible scenario would be if you have several asynchronous tasks, which is
a common scenario. You can imagine that you want to process the results as fast
as possible, so you want to ask the futures for their result several times. If
no result is available, maybe you want to do something else. Here is a possible
implementation:</p>

<p>The three tasks are started asynchronously with <code>std::async</code> and the
resulting <code>std::future</code> are stored. Then, as long as one of the tasks is
not complete, we query each three task and try to process its result. If no
result is available, we simply do something else. This example is important to
understand, it covers pretty much every concept of the futures.</p>
<p>One interesting thing that remains is that you can pass parameters to your task
via <code>std::async</code>. Indeed, all the extra parameters that you pass to
<code>std::async</code> will be passed to the task itself. Here is an example of
spawning tasks in a loop with different parameters:</p>

<p>Pretty practical :) All The created <code>std::future&lt;size_t&gt;</code> are stored in
a <code>std::vector</code> and then are all queried for their result.</p>
<p>Overall, I think <code>std::future</code> and <code>std::async</code> are great tool that
can simplify your asynchronous code a lot. They allow you to make pretty
advanced stuff while keeping the complexity of the code to a minimum.</p>
<p>I hope this long-due post is going to be interesting to some of you :)
The code for this post is available <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/articles/tree/master/src/threads/part5">on Github</a></p>
<p>I do not yet know if there will be a next installment in the series. I've
covered pretty much everything that is available in C++11 for concurrency. I may
cover the parallel algorithms of C++17 in a following post. If you have any
suggestion for the next post, don't hesitate to post a comment or contact me

<p>Often if you write templated code, you have to write and use a lot of different
traits. In this article, I'll focus on the traits that are representing values,
typically a boolean value. For instance, std::is_const, std::is_same or
std::is_reference are type traits provided by the STL. They are giving you some
information at compile time for a certain type. If you need to write a type
traits, let's say is_float, here is how you would maybe do it in C++11:</p>

</pre>
<p>or a bit nicer with a template type alias and std::integral constant:</p>
<pre class="code c++"><a name="rest_code_98437923a7b8418785b97631aa905ba8-1"></a><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

</pre>
<p>or since is_same is itself a type traits, you can also directly alias it:</p>
<pre class="code c++"><a name="rest_code_c9c6b48e1bb243819945620c6c4ec6f3-1"></a><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

</pre>
<p>This makes for some very nice syntax, but we still have a type rather than a value.</p>
<p>Note that in some cases, you cannot use the using technique since it cannot be
specialized and you often need specialization to write some more advanced
traits.</p>
<p>And then you would use your traits to do something specific based on that
information. For instance with a very basic example:</p>
<pre class="code C++"><a name="rest_code_17eb047bcf784b749c286632e2bf64ad-1"></a><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<p>Really nothing fancy here, but that will be enough as examples.</p>
<p>Even though all this works pretty, it can be made better on two points. First,
every time you use a traits, you need to use the value member (via ::value).
Secondly, every time you declare a new traits, you have to declare a new type or
a type alias. But all you want is a boolean value.</p>
<p>C++14 introduced a new feature, variable templates. As their name indicates,
they are variables, parametrized with a type. This allows us to write type
traits without using a type alias or struct, meaning we have a real value
instead of a type. If we rewrite our is_float traits with variable templates, we
have the following:</p>
<pre class="code c++"><a name="rest_code_ce013db6b109420b88e0880ff16e1150-1"></a><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<a name="rest_code_ce013db6b109420b88e0880ff16e1150-2"></a><span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">is_float</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">is_same</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">float</span><span class="o">&gt;::</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre>
<p>I think it's much nicer, the intent is clearly stated and there is no
unnecessary code. Moreover, it's also nicer to use:</p>
<pre class="code C++"><a name="rest_code_c3360721c4f4457fbe80a152dda6758c-1"></a><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

</pre>
<p>No more ::value everywhere :) I think it's really cool.</p>
<p>Note that, unlike type alias template, they can be specialized, either fully or
partially, so no more limitation on that side.</p>
<p>Interestingly, variable templates are used in C++17 to provide helpers for each
type traits with values. For instance, std::is_same will have a std::is_same_v
helper that is a variable template. With that, we can simplify our traits a bit
more:</p>
<pre class="code c++"><a name="rest_code_f6b41928468e41cb82cf7446e65d1321-1"></a><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<a name="rest_code_f6b41928468e41cb82cf7446e65d1321-2"></a><span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">is_float</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">is_same_v</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">float</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre>
<p>Personally, I replaced all the type traits inside ETL using variable templates.
If you don't want to do it, you can also introduce helpers like in the C++17 STL
and start using the wrappers when you see fit so that you don't break any code.</p>
<p>If you want to use this feature, you need a C++14 compiler, such as any version
from GCC5 family or clang 3.6. Although I haven't tested, it should also work on
Microsoft VS2015 Update 2.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is a bug in both clang (fixed in clang 3.7) and GCC (fixed
in GCC 6 only) that you may encounter if you start using variable templates in
template classes or variable templates used in another variable templates. If
you plan to use variable templates inside a template, such as something like
this:</p>

<p>You will encounter a not-helpful at all error message with GCC5 family, such as:</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_ae5d855f51d64234b2746c00dd4e5a84-1"></a>test.cpp: In instantiation of ‘constexpr const bool outer_helper&lt;float, float&gt;’:

</pre>
<p>It comes from a bug in the handling of variable templates as dependent names. If
you don't come in this cases, you can use GCC5 family directly, otherwise,
you'll have to use GCC6 family only.</p>
<p>I hope this can help some of you to improve your type traits or at least to
discover the power of the new variable templates. Personally, I've rewritten all
the traits from the ETL library using this new feature and I'm pretty satisfied
with the result. Of course, that means that the compiler support was reduced,
but since I don't have many users, it's not a real issue.</p>

<p>I just started growing again my RAID6 array from 12 to 13 disks and
I encountered a new issue. The reshape started, but with a speed of 0K/s. After
some searching, I found a very simple solution:</p>
<pre class="code bash"><a name="rest_code_3292154f65b644f082ea03717625820e-1"></a><span class="nb">echo</span> max &gt; /sys/block/md0/md/sync_max
</pre>
<p>And the reshape started directly at 50M/s :)</p>
<p>The solution is the same if you are growing any type of RAID level with parity
(RAID5, RAID6, ...).</p>
<p>Normally, the issues I have are related to speed not very good. I've written
a post in the post about
<a class="reference external" href="https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2015/03/how-to-speed-up-raid-5-6-growing-with-mdadm.html">how to speed up RAID5 / RAID6 growing with mdadm</a>.
Although RAID5 / RAID6 growing, or another reshape operation, will never be very
fast, you can still speed up the process a lot from a few days to a few hours.
Currently, my reshape is working at 48M/s and I'm looking at around 16 hours of
reshape, but I have 13 disks of 3To, so it's not so bad.</p>
<p>I hope this very simple tip can be helpful to some of you :)</p>

        <div>
<p>A few weeks ago, I talked about all
<a class="reference external" href="https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/07/update-on-deep-learning-library-dll-dropout-batch-normalization-adaptive-learning-rates.html">the new features of my Deep Learning Library (DLL)</a>
project. I've mentioned that, on several experiments, DLL was always
significantly faster than some popular deep learning frameworks such as
TensorFlow. I'll now go into more details into this comparison and provide all
the results. So far, the paper we wrote about these results has not been
published, so I'll not provide the paper directly yet.</p>
<p>For those that may not know, DLL is the project I've been developing to support
my Ph.D. thesis. This is a neural network framework  that supports
Fully-Connected Neural Network (FCNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Convolutional RBM
(CRBM) and Convolutional DBN (CDBN). It also supports a large variety of options
such as Dropout, Batch Normalization and Adaptive Learning Rates. You can read
read the
<a class="reference external" href="https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/07/update-on-deep-learning-library-dll-dropout-batch-normalization-adaptive-learning-rates.html">previous post</a>
if you want more information about the new features of the framework. And, as those of
you that read my blog frequently may know, I'm a bit obsessed with performance
optimization, so I've spent a considerable amount of time optimizing
the performance of neural network training, on CPU. Since, at the beginning of my
thesis, I had no access to GPU for training, I've focused on CPU. Although there
is now support for GPU, the gains are not yet important enough.</p>
<div class="section" id="evaluation">
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>To see how fast, or not, the library was, it was compared against five popular
machine learning libraries:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Caffe, installed from sources</li>
<li>TensorFlow 1.0, from pip</li>
<li>Keras 2.0, from pip</li>
<li>Torch, installed from sources</li>
<li>DeepLearning4J 0.7, from Maven</li>
</ol>
<p>I've run four different experiments with all these frameworks and compared the
efficiency of each of them for training the same neural networks with the same
options. In each case, the training or testing error have also been compared to
ensure that each framework is doing roughly the same. I wont present here the
details, but in each experiment DLL showed around the same accuracies as the
other frameworks. I will only focus on the speed results in this article.</p>
<p>Each experiment is done once with only CPU and once with a GPU. For DLL, I only
report the CPU time in both modes, since it's more stable and more optimized.</p>
<p>The code for the evaluation is available online on the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/frameworks">Github repository of the frameworks project</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="mnist-fully-connected-neural-network">
<h2>MNIST: Fully Connected Neural Network</h2>
<p>The first experiment is performed on The MNIST data set. It consists of 60'000
grayscale images of size 28x28. The goal is to classify each image of a digit
from 0 to 9. To solve this task, I trained a very small fully-connected neural
network with 500 hidden units in the first layer, 250 in the second and 10 final
hidden units (or output units) for classification. The first two layers are
using the logistic sigmoid activation function and the last layer is using the
softmax activation function. The network is trained for 50 epochs with a
categorical cross entropy loss, with mini-batches of 100 images. Here are
results of this experiment:</p>

</div>
<p>In DLL mode, the DLL framework is the clear winner here! It's about 35% faster
than TensorFlow and Keras which are coming at the second place. DLL is more than
four times slower than DLL and the last two frameworks (Caffe and
DeepLearning4J) are five times slower than DLL! Once we add a GPU to the system,
the results are very different. Caffe is now the fastest framework, three times
faster than DLL. DLL is less than two times slower than Keras and TensorFlow.
Interestingly, DLL is still faster than Torch and DeepLearning4J.</p>

is to use Convolutional Neural Network which have proved very efficient at
solving a lot of problems. The second experiment is also using the same data
set. Again, it's a rather small network. The first layer is a convolutional
layer with 8 5x5 kernels, followed by max pooling layer with 2x2 kernel. They
are followed by one more convolutional layers with 8 5x5 kernels and a 2x2 max
pooling layer. These first four layers are followed by two fully-connected
layers, the first with 150 hidden units and the last one with 10 output units.
The activation functions are the same as for the first network, as is the
training procedure. This takes significantly longer to train than the first
network because of the higher complexity of the convolutional layers compared to
the fully-connected layers even though they have much less weights. The results
are present in the next figure:</p>

Neural Network experiment, on MNIST. All the times are in seconds.</p>
</div>
<p>Again, on CPU, DLL is the clear winner, by a lot! It's already 3.6 times faster
than the second frameworks Keras and TensorFlow, more than four times faster
than Caffe and Torch and 8 times faster than DeepLearning4J that is proving very
slow on this experiment. Once a GPU is added, Keras and TensorFlow are about
twice faster than DLL. However, DLL is still faster than the other frameworks
even though they are taking advantage of the GPU.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cifar-10">
<h2>CIFAR-10</h2>
<p>The second data set that is tested is the CIFAR-10 data set. It's an object
recognition with 10 classes for classification. The training set is composed of
50'000 colour images for 32x32 pixels. The network that is used for this data
set is similar in architecture than the first network, but has more parameters.
The first convolutional layer now has 12 5x5 kernels and the second
convolutional layer has 24 3x3 kernels. The pooling layers are the same. The
first fully-connected has 64 hidden units and the last one has 10 output units.
The last layer again use a softmax activation function while the other layers
are using Rectifier Linear Units (ReLU). The training is done in the same manner
as for the two first networks. Unfortunately, it was not possible to train
DeepLearning4J on this data set, even though there is official support for this
data set. Since I've had no answer to my question regarding this issue, the
results are simply removed from this experiment. It may not seem so but it's
considerably longer to train this network because of the larger number of input
channels and larger number of convolutional kernels in each layer. Let's get to
the results now:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Training time performance for the different frameworks on the Convolutional Neural Network experiment, on CIFAR-10." src="images/dll_cifar10.png"><p class="caption">Training time performance for the different frameworks on the Convolutional
Neural Network experiment, on CIFAR-10. All the times are in seconds.</p>
</div>
<p>DLL is still the fastest on CPU, but the margin is less than before. It's about
40% faster than TensorFlow and Keras, twice faster than Torch and 2.6 times
faster than Caffe. Once a GPU is added, DLL is about as fast as Torch but slower
than the other three frameworks. TensorFlow and Keras are about four times
faster than DLL while Caffe is about twice faster than DLL. We can see that
with this larger network, the GPU becomes more interesting and that there is
a smaller margin for improvements compared to the other frameworks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="imagenet">
<h2>ImageNet</h2>
<p>The last experiment is made on the ImageNet data set. I used the ILSVRC 2012
subset, that consists "only" of about 1.2 million images for training. I've
resized all the images to 256x256 pixels, this makes for 250 times more colour
values than a MNIST image. This dimension and the number of images makes it
impractical to keep the dataset in memory. The images must be loaded in batch
from the disk. No random cropping or mirroring was performed. The network is
much larger to solve this task. The network starts with 5 pairs of convolutional
layers and max pooling layers. The convolutional layers have 3x3 kernels, 16 for
the first two layers and 32 for the three following one. The five max pooling
layers use 2x2 kernels. Each convolutional layer uses zero-padding so that their
output features are the same dimensions as the input. They are followed by two
fully-connected layer. The first one with 2048 hidden units and the last one
with 1000 output units (one for each class). Except for the last layer, using
softmax, the layers all uses ReLU. The network is trained with mini-batches of
128 images (except for DeepLearning4J and Torch, which can only use 64 images on
the amount of RAM available on my machine). To ease the comparison, I report the
time necessary to train one batch of data (or two for DeepLearning4J and Torch).
The results, presented in logarithmic scale because of DeepLearning4J disastrous
results, are as follows:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Training time performance for the different frameworks on the Convolutional Neural Network experiment, on ImageNet." src="images/dll_imagenet.png"><p class="caption">Training time performance for the different frameworks on the Convolutional
Neural Network experiment, on ImageNet. The times are the time necessary to
train a batch of 128 images. All the times are in milliseconds.</p>
</div>
<p>For this final experiment, DLL is again significantly faster than all the other
frameworks. It's about 40% faster than Keras, twice faster than TensorFlow and
Caffe and more than three times faster than Torch. Although 40% may seem not
that much, don't forget that this kind of training may take days, so it can save
you a lot of time. All the frameworks are much faster than DeepLearning4J. Based
on several posts on the internet, I suspect that this comes from the model of
GPU I have been used (GTX 960), but all the other frameworks seem to handle this
card pretty well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion-3">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this is not too much of a bragging post :P We can see that my efforts to
make the code as fast as possible have paid :) As was shown in the experiments,
my DLL framework is always the fastest framework when the neural network is
trained on CPU. I'm quite pleased with the results since I've done a lot of work
to optimize the speed as much as possible and since I'm competing with
well-known libraries that have been developed by several persons.  Moreover, the
accuracies of the trained networks is similar to that of the networks trained
with the other frameworks. Even when the other frameworks are using GPU, the
library still remains competitive, although never the fastest.</p>
<p>In the next step (I've no idea when I'll have the time though), I will want to
focus on GPU speed. This will mostly come from a better support of the GPU in
the ETL library on which DLL is based. I have many ideas to improve it a lot,
but it will take me a lot of time.</p>
<p>If you want more information on the DLL library, you can have a look at
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/dll">its Github repository</a> and especially at
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/dll/tree/master/examples/src">the few examples</a>.
You can also have a look at <a class="reference external" href="https://baptiste-wicht.com/categories/dll.html">my posts about DLL</a>.

        <hr>
<div class="p-summary">
        <div>
<p>It's been a while since I've done a benchmark of different compilers on C++
code. Since I've recently
<a class="reference external" href="https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/08/expression-templates-library-etl-11.html">released the version 1.1 of my ETL project</a>
(an optimized matrix/vector computation library with expression templates), I've
decided to use it as the base of my benchmark. It's a C++14 library with a lot
of templates. I'm going to compile the full test suite (124 test cases). This is
done directly on the last release (1.1) code. I'm going to compile once in debug
mode and once in release_debug (release plus debug symbols and assertions) and
record the times for each compiler. The tests were compiled with support for
every option in ETL to account to maximal compilation time. Each compilation was
made using four threads (make -j4). I'm also going to test a few of the
benchmarks to see the difference in runtime performance between the code
generated by each compiler. The benchmark will be compiled in release mode and
its compilation time recorded as well.</p>
<p>I'm going to test the following compilers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>GCC-4.9.4</li>
<li>GCC-5.4.0</li>
<li>GCC-6.3.0</li>
<li>GCC-7.1.0</li>
<li>clang-3.9.1</li>
<li>clang-4.0.1</li>
<li>zapcc-1.0 (commercial, based on clang-5.0 trunk)</li>
</ul>
<p>All have been installed directly using Portage (Gentoo package manager) except
for clang-4.0.1 that has been installed from sources and zapcc since it does not
have a Gentoo package. Since clang package on Gentoo does not support
multislotting, I had to install one version from source and the other from the
package manager. This is also the reason I'm testing less versions of clang,
simply less practical.</p>
<p>For the purpose of these tests, the exact same options have been used throughout
all the compilers. Normally, I use different options for clang than for GCC
(mainly more aggressive vectorization options on clang). This may not lead to
the best performance for each compiler, but allows for comparison between the
results with defaults optimization level. Here are the main options used:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In debug mode: -g</li>
<li>In release_debug mode: -g -O2</li>
<li>In release mode: -g -O3 -DNDEBUG -fomit-frame-pointer</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case, a lot of warnings are enabled and the ETL options are the same.</p>
<p>All the results have been gathered on a Gentoo machine running on Intel Core
i7-2600 (Sandy Bridge...) @3.4GHz with 4 cores and 8 threads, 12Go of RAM and
a SSD. I do my best to isolate as much as possible the benchmark from
perturbations and that my benchmark code is quite sound, it may well be that
some results are not totally accurate. Moreover, some of the benchmarks are
using multithreading, which may add some noise and unpredictability. When I was
not sure about the results, I ran the benchmarks several time to confirm them
and overall I'm confident of the results.</p>

<h2>Compilation Time</h2>
<p>Let's start with the results of the performance of the compilers themselves:</p>

</table>
<p>Note: For Release_Debug and Benchmark, I only use three threads with zapcc,
because 12Go of RAM is not enough memory for four threads.</p>
<p>There are some very significant differences between the different compilers.
Overall, clang-4.0.1 is by far the fastest free compiler for Debug mode. When
the tests are compiled with optimizations however, clang is falling behind.
It's quite impressive how clang-4.0.1 manages to be so much faster than
clang-3.9.1 both in debug mode and release mode. Really great work by the clang
team here! With these optimizations, clang-4.0.1 is almost on par with gcc-7.1
in release mode.  For GCC, it seems that the cost of optimization has been going
up quite significantly. However, GCC 7.1 seems to have made optimization faster
and standard compilation much faster as well. If we take into account zapcc,
it's the fastest compiler on debug mode, but it's slower than several gcc
versions on release mode.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm quite impressed by the performance of clang-4.0.1 which seems
really fast! I'll definitely make more tests with this new version of the
compiler in the near future. It's also good to see that g++-7.1 also did make
the build faster than gcc-6.3. However, the fastest gcc version for optimization
is still gcc-4.9.4 which is already an old branch with low C++ standard support.</p>

<h2>Runtime Performance</h2>
<p>Let's now take a look at the quality of the generated code. For some of the
benchmarks, I've included two versions of the algorithm. <em>std</em> is the most
simple algorithm (the naive one) and <em>vec</em> is the hand-crafted vectorized and
optimized implementation. All the tests were done on single-precision floating
points.</p>

<p>The differences are not very significant between the different compilers. The
clang-based compilers seem to be the compilers producing the fastest code.
Interestingly, there seem to have been a big regression in gcc-6.3 for large
containers, but that has been fixed in gcc-7.1.</p>

<p>If we look at the optimized version, the differences are even slower. Again, the

<p>Interestingly, we can see that gcc-7.1 is the fastest for small vectors while
clang-4.0 is the best for producing code for larger vectors. However, except for
the biggest vector size, the difference is not really significantly. Apparently,
there is a regression in zapcc (or clang-5.0) since it's slower than clang-4.0
at the same level as clang-3.9.</p>

<p>Even on the biggest vector, this is a very fast operation, once vectorized and
parallelized. At this speed, some of the differences observed may not be highly
significant. Again clang-based versions are the fastest versions on this code,
but by a small margin.  There also seems to be a slight regression in gcc-7.1,
but again quite small.</p>

<p>This time, the differences between the different compilers are very significant.
The clang compilers are leading the way by a large margin here, with clang-4.0
being the fastest of them (by another nice margin). Indeed, clang-4.0.1 is
producing code that is, on average, about twice faster than the code generated
by the best GCC compiler. Very interestingly as well, we can see a huge
regression starting from GCC-5.4 and that is still here in GCC-7.1. Indeed, the
best GCC version, in the tested versions, is again GCC-4.9.4. Clang is really
doing an excellent job of compiling the GEMM code.</p>

<p>As for the optimized version, it seems that the two families are reversed.
Indeed, GCC is doing a better job than clang here, and although the margin is
not as big as before, it's still significant. We can still observe a small
regression in GCC versions because the 4.9 version is again the fastest. As for
clang versions, it seems that clang-5.0 (used in zapcc) has had some performance
improvements for this case.</p>
<p>For this case of matrix-matrix multiplication, it's very impressive that the
differences in the non-optimized code are so significant. And it's also
impressive that each family of compilers has its own strength, clang being
seemingly much better at handling unoptimized code while GCC is better at
handling vectorized code.</p>

<p>This time, clang manages to produce excellent results. Indeed, all the produced
executables are significantly faster than the versions produced by GCC, except
for GCC-7.1 which is producing similar results. The other versions of GCC are
falling behind it seems. It seems that it was only for the GEMM that clang was
having a lot of troubles handling the optimized code.</p>

<div class="section" id="conclusion-2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Clang seems to have recently done a lot of optimizations regarding compilation
time. Indeed, clang-4.0.1 is much faster for compilation than clang-3.9.
Although GCC-7.1 is faster than GCC-6.3, all the GCC versions are slower than
GCC-4.9.4 which is the fastest at compiling code with optimizations. GCC-7.1 is
the fastest GCC version for compiling code in debug mode.</p>
<p>In some cases, there is almost no difference between different compilers in the
generated code. However, in more  complex algorithms such as the matrix-matrix
multiplication or the two-dimensional convolution, the differences can be quite
significant. In my tests, Clang have shown to be much better at compiling
unoptimized code. However, and especially in the GEMM case, it seems to be worse
than GCC at handling hand-optimized. I will investigate that case and try to
tailor the code so that clang is having a better time with it.</p>
<p>For me, it's really weird that the GCC regression, apparently starting from
GCC-5.4, has still not been fixed in GCC 7.1. I was thinking of dropping support
for GCC-4.9 in order to go full C++14 support, but now I may have to reconsider
my position. However, seeing that GCC is generally the best at handling
optimized code (especially for GEMM), I may be able to do the transition, since
the optimized code will be used in most cases.</p>
<p>As for zapcc, although it is still the fastest compiler in debug mode, with the
new speed of clang-4.0.1, its margin is quite small. Moreover, on optimized
build, it's not as fast as GCC. If you use clang and can have access to zapcc,
it's still quite a good option to save some time.</p>
<p>Overall, I have been quite pleased by clang-4.0.1 and GCC-7.1, the most recent
versions I have been testing. It seems that they did quite some good work.
I will definitely run some more tests with them and try to adapt the code. I'm
still considering whether I will drop support for some older compilers.</p>
<p>I hope this comparison was interesting :) My next post will probably be about
the difference in performance between my machine learning framework and other
frameworks to train neural networks.</p>

<img alt="ETL Logo" class="align-center" src="images/logo.png"><p>It took me longer than I thought, but I'm glad to announce the release of the
version 1.1 of my Expression Templates Library (ETL) project. This is a major
new release with many improvements and new features. It's been almost one month
since the last, and first, release (1.0) was released. I should have done some
minor releases in the mean time, but at least now the library is in a good shape
for major version.</p>
<p>It may be interesting to note that my machine learning framework (DLL), based on
the ETL library, has shown to be faster than all the tested popular frameworks
(Tensorflow, Keras, Caffee, Torch, DeepLearning4J) for training various neural
networks on CPU. I'll post more details on another post on the coming weeks, but
that shows that special attention to performance has been done in this library
and that it is well adapted to machine learning.</p>
<p>For those of you that don't follow my blog, ETL is a library providing
Expression Templates for computations on matrix and vector. For instance, if you
have three matrices A, B and C you could write C++ code like this:</p>
<pre class="code cpp"><a name="rest_code_400266acd04e4d91a5cb87e11ce88cfc-1"></a><span class="n">C</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">2.0</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">B</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="n">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">A</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>Or given vectors b, v, h and a matrix W, you could write code like this:</p>
<pre class="code cpp"><a name="rest_code_21fdc2f53d834faf9aa9ca5c031334ba-1"></a><span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sigmoid</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">W</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>The goal of such library is two-fold. First, this makes the expression more
readable and as close to math as possible. And then, it allows the library to
compute the expressions as fast as possible.  In the first case, the framework
will compute the sum using a vectorized algorithm and then compute the overall
expression using yet again vectorized code. The expression can also be computed
in parallel if the matrices are big enough. In the second case, the
vector-matrix multiplication will be computed first using either hand-code
optimized vectorized or a BLAS routine (depending on configuration options).
Then, all the expression will be executed using vectorized code.</p>
<div class="section" id="features">
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Many new features have been integrated into the library.</p>
<p>The support for machine learning operations has been improved. There are now
specific helpers for machine learning in the etl::ml namespace which have names
that are standard to machine learning. A real transposed convolution has been
implemented with support for padding and stride. Batched outer product and
batched bias averaging are also now supported. The activation function support
has also been improved and the derivatives have been reviewed. The pooling
operators have also been improved with stride and padding support. Unrelated to
machine learning, 2D and 3D pooling can also be done in higher dimensional
matrix now.</p>
<p>New functions are also available for matrices and vectors. The support for
square root has been improved with cubic root and inverse root. Support has also
been added for floor and ceil. Moreover, comparison operators are now available
as well as global functions such as approx_equals.</p>
<p>New reductions have also been added with support for absolute sum and mean
(asum/asum) and for min_index and max_index, which returns the index of the
minimum element, respectively the maximum. Finally, argmax can now be used to
get the max index in each sub dimensions of a matrix. argmax on a vector is
equivalent to max_index.</p>
<p>Support for shuffling has also been added. By default, shuffling a vector means
shuffling all elements and shuffling a matrix means shuffling by shuffling the
sub matrices (only the first dimension is shuffled), but shuffling a matrix as
a vector is also possible. Shuffle of two vectors or two matrices in parallel,
is also possible. In that case, the same permutation is applied to both
containers. As a side note, all operations using random generation are also
available with an addition parameter for the random generator, which can help to
improve reproducibility or simply tune the random generator.</p>
<p>I've also included support for adapters matrices. There are adapters for
hermitian matrices, symmetric matrices and lower and upper triangular matrices.
For now, the framework does not take advantage of this information, this will be
done later, but the framework guarantee the different constrain on the content.</p>
<p>There are also a few new more minor features. Maybe not so minor, matrices can
now be sliced into sub matrices. With that a matrix can be divided into several
sub matrices and modifying the sub matrices will modify the source matrix. The
sub matrices are available in 2D, 3D and 4D for now. There are also some other
ways of slicing matrix and vectors. It is possible to obtain a slice of its
memory or obtain a slice of its first dimension. Another new feature is that it
is now possible compute the cross product of vectors now. Matrices can be
decomposed into their Q/R decomposition rather than only their PALU
decomposition. Special support has been integrated for matrix and vectors of
booleans. In that case, they support logical operators such as and, not and or.</p>

<div class="section" id="performance">
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>I've always considered the performance of this library to be a feature itself.
I consider the library to be quite fast, especially its convolution support,
even though there is still room for improvement. Therefore, many improvements
have been made to the performance of the library since the last release. As said
before, this library was used in a machine learning framework which then proved
faster than most popular neural network frameworks on CPU. I'll present here
the most important new improvements to performance, in no real particular order,
every bit being important in my opinion.</p>
<p>First, several operations have been optimized to be faster.</p>
<p>Multiplication of matrices or matrices and vectors are now much faster if one of
the matrix is transposed. Instead of performing the slow transposition,
different kernels are used in order to maximize performance without doing any
transposition, although sometimes transposition is performed when it is faster.
This leads to very significant improvements, up to 10 times faster in the best
case. This is performed for vectorized kernels and also for BLAS and CUBLAS
calls. These new kernels are also directly used when matrices of different
storage order are used. For instance, multiplying a column major matrix with
a row major matrix and storing the result in a column major matrix is now much
more efficient than before. Moreover, the performance of the transpose operation
itself is also much faster than before.</p>
<p>A lot of machine learning operations have also been highly optimized. All the
pooling and upsample operators are now parallelized and the most used kernel
(2x2 pooling) is now more optimized. 4D convolution kernels (for machine
learning) have been greatly improved. There are now very specialized vectorized
kernels for classic kernel configurations (for instance 3x3 or 5x5) and the
selection of implementations is now smarter than before. The support of padding
is now much better than before for small amount of padding. Moreover, for small
kernels the full convolution can now be evaluated using the valid convolution
kernels directly with some padding, for much faster overall performance. The
exponential operation is now vectorized which allows operations such as sigmoid
or softmax to be much faster.</p>
<p>Matrices and vector are automatically using aligned memory. This means that
vectorized code can use aligned operations, which may be slightly faster.
Moreover, matrices and vectors are now padded to a multiple of the vector size.
This allows to remove the final non-vectorized remainder loop from the
vectorized code. This is only done for the end of matrices, when they are
accessed in flat way. Contrary to some frameworks, inner dimensions of the
matrix are not padded.  Finally, accesses to 3D and 4D matrices is now much
faster than before.</p>
<p>Then, the parallelization feature of ETL has been completely reworked. Before,
there was a thread pool for each algorithm that was parallelized. Now, there is
a global thread engine with one thread pool. Since parallelization is not nested
in ETL, this improves performance slightly by greatly diminishing the number of
threads that are created throughout an application. Another big difference in
parallel dispatching is that now it can detect good split based on alignment so
that each split are aligned. This then allows the vectorization process to use
aligned stores and loads instead of unaligned ones which may be faster on some
processors.</p>
<p>Vectorization has also been greatly improved in ETL. Integer operations are now
automatically vectorized on processors that support this. Before, only floating
points operations were vectorized. The automatic vectorizer now is able to use
non-temporal stores for very large operations. A non-temporal store bypasses the
cache, thus gaining some time. Since very large matrices do not fit in cache
anyway and the cache would end up being overwritten anyway, this is a net gain.
Moreover, the alignment detection in the automatic vectorizer has also been
improved. Support for Fused-Multiply-Add (FMA) operations has also been
integrated in the algorithms that can make use of it (multiplications and
convolutions). The matrix-matrix multiplications and vector-matrix
multiplications now have highly optimized vectorized kernels. They also have
versions for column-major matrices now.  I plan to reintegrate a version of the
GEMM based on BLIS in the future but with more optimizations and support for all
precisions and integers, For my version is still slower than the simple
vectorized version. The sum and the dot product operations now also have
specialized vectorized implementations. The min and max operations are now
automatically-vectorized. Several others algorithms have also their own
vectorized implementations.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, the GPU support has also been almost completely reworked.
Now, several operations can be chained without any copies between GPU and CPU.
Several new operations have also been added with support to GPU (convolutions,
pooling, sigmoid, ReLU, ...). Moreover, to complement operations that are not
available in any of the supported NVIDIA libraries, I've created a simple
library that can be used to add a few more GPU operations.  Nevertheless a lot
of operations are still missing and only algorithms are available not
expressions (such as c = a + b * 1.0) that are entirely computed on CPU. I have
plans to improve that further, probably for version 1.2. The different contexts
necessary for NVIDIA library can now be cached (using an option from ETL),
leading to much faster code. Only the main handle can be cached so far, I plan
to try to cache all the descriptors, but I don't know yet when that will be
ready. Finally, an option is also available to reuse GPU memory instead of
directly releasing it to CUDA. This is using a custom memory pool and can save
some time. Since this needs to be cleaned (by a call to etl::exit() or using
ETL_PROLOGUE), this is only activated on demand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-changes">
<h2>Other changes</h2>
<p>There also have been a lot of refactorings in the code of the library. A lot of
expressions now have less overhead and are specialized for performance.
Moreover, temporary expressions have been totally reworked to be more simple and
maintainable and easier to optimize in the future. It's also probably easier to
add new expressions to the framework now, although that could be even more
simple. There are also less duplicated code now in the different expressions.
Especially, now there are now more SSE and AVX variants in the code. All the
optimized algorithms are now using the vectorization system of the library.</p>
<p>I also tried my best to reduce the compilation time, based on the unit tests.
This is still not great but better than before. For user code, the next version
should be much faster to compile since I plan to disable forced selection of
implementations by default and only enable it on demand.</p>
<p>Finally, there also was quite a few bug fixes. Most of them have been found by
the use of the library in the Deep Learning Library (DLL) project. Some were
very small edge cases. For instance, the transposition algorithm was not working
on GPU on rectangular column major matrices. There also was a slight bug in the
Q/R decomposition and in the pooling of 4D matrices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next ?</h2>
<p>Next time, I may do some minor release, but I don't yet have a complete plan.
For the next major release (1.2 probably), here is what is planned:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Review the system for selection of algorithms to reduce compilation time</li>
<li>Review the GPU system to allow more complete support for standard operators</li>
<li>Switch to C++17: there are many improvements that could be done to the code with C++17 features</li>
<li>Add support for convolution on mixed types (float/double)</li>
<li>More tests for sparse matrix</li>
<li>More algorithms support for sparse matrix</li>
<li>Reduce the compilation time of the library in general</li>
<li>Reduce the compilation and execution time of the unit tests</li>
</ul>
<p>These are pretty big changes, especially the first two, so maybe it'll be split
into several releases. It will really depend on the time I have. As for C++17,
I really want to try it and I have a lot of points that could profit from the
switch, but that will means setting GCC 7.1 and Clang 3.9 as minimum
requirement, which may not be reasonable for every user.</p>

<h2>Download ETL</h2>
<p>You can download ETL <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl">on Github</a>. If you
only interested in the 1.1 version, you can look at the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl/releases">Releases pages</a> or clone the tag
1.1. There are several branches:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<em>master</em> Is the eternal development branch, may not always be stable</li>
<li>
<em>stable</em> Is a branch always pointing to the last tag, no development here</li>
</ul>
<p>For the future release, there always will tags pointing to the corresponding
commits. I'm not following the git flow way, I'd rather try to have a more
linear history with one eternal development branch, rather than an useless
develop branch or a load of other branches for releases.</p>
<p>The documentation is a bit sparse. There are a few examples and the Wiki, but
there still is work to be done. If you have questions on how to use or configure
the library, please don't hesitate.</p>
<p>Don't hesitate to comment this post if you have any comment on this library or
any question. You can also open an Issue on Github if you have a problem using
this library or propose a Pull Request if you have any contribution you'd like
to make to the library.</p>
<p>Hope this may be useful to some of you :)</p>

        <div>
<p>It's been a while since I've posted something on this, especially since I had
one month vacation. This year I've been able to integrate a great number of
changes into my Deep Learning Library (DLL) project. It has seen a lot of
refactorings and a lot of new features making it look like a real neural network
library now. In this post, I'll try to outline the last new features and changes
of the library.</p>
<p>For those that don't know, DLL is a library for neural network training, written
in C++ and for C++. You can train Fully-Connected Neural Networks and
Convolutional Neural Networks. The focus of the framework is on speed and easy
use in C++.</p>
<p>As for my ETL project and again thanks to my thesis supervisor, the project now
has a logo:</p>
<img alt="DLL Logo" class="align-center" src="images/dll_logo.png"><div class="section" id="adaptive-learning-rates">
<h2>Adaptive Learning Rates</h2>
<p>Before, the framework only supported simple SGD and Momentum updates for the
different parameters of the network. Moreover, it was not very well extendable.
Therefore, I reviewed the system to be able to configure an optimizer for each
network to train. Once that was done, the first thing I did was to add support
for Nesterov Accelerated Gradients (NAG) as a third optimizer. After this,
I realized it was then easy to integrate support for more advanced optimizers
including support for adaptive learning rates. This means that the learning rate
will be adapted for each parameter depending on what the network is learning.
Some of the optimizers even don't need any learning rate. So far, I've
implemented support for the following optimizers: Adagrad, RMSProp, Adam (with
and without bias correction), Adamax (Adam with infinite norm), Nadam (Adam with
Nesterov momentum) and Adadelta (no more learning rate). The user can now choose
the optimizer of its choice, for instance NADAM, as a parameter of the network:</p>
<pre class="code c++"><a name="rest_code_e2ef621fb991425d9fd1531a11be5d8f-1"></a><span class="c1">// Use a Nadam optimizer</span>
<a name="rest_code_e2ef621fb991425d9fd1531a11be5d8f-2"></a><span class="n">dll</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">updater</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">dll</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">updater_type</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">NADAM</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>Another improvement in the same domain is that the learning rate can also be
decayed over time automatically by the optimizer.</p>
<p>If you want more information on the different optimizers, you can have a look at
this very good article:
<a class="reference external" href="http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/">An overview of gradient descent optimization algorithms</a>
from Sebastian Ruder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="better-loss-support">
<h2>Better loss support</h2>
<p>Before, DLL was automatically using Categorical Cross Entropy Loss, but it was
not possible to change it and it was not even possible to see the loss over
time. Now, the current value of the loss is displayed after each epoch of
training and the loss used for training is now configurable. So far, only three
different losses are supported, but it it not difficult to add new loss to the
system. The three losses supported are: Categorical Cross Entropy Loss, Binary
Cross Entropy Loss and Mean Squared Error Loss.</p>
<p>Again, each network can specify the loss to use:</p>
<pre class="code C++"><a name="rest_code_6be3701cabbd4bf584c6631644b9530f-1"></a><span class="c1">// Use a Binary Cross Entropy Loss</span>

</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dropout">
<h2>Dropout</h2>
<p>Dropout is a relatively new technique for neural network training. This is
especially made to reduce overfitting since a large number of sub networks will
be trained and it should prevent co-adaptation between different neurons. This
technique is relatively simple. Indeed, it simply randomly sets to zero some of
the input neurons of layers. At each batch, a new mask will be used and this
should lead to a large number of sub networks being trained.</p>
<p>Here is example of a MLP with Dropout (p=0.5):</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="batch-normalization">
<h2>Batch Normalization</h2>
<p>Batch Normalization is another new technique for training neural networks. This
technique will ensure that each of the layer will receive inputs that look
kind of similar. This is a very large advantage since then you reduce the
different in impact of hyper parameters on different layers. Google reported
much faster training with this technique by getting rid of Dropout and by
increasing the learning rate of training.</p>
<p>Here is an example of using Batch Normalization in a CNN:</p>

<p>You may notice that the layer is set as 4D so should only be used after
convolutional layer (or after the input). If you want to use it after
fully-connected layers, you can use the 2D version that works the same way.</p>

<div class="section" id="better-dataset-support">
<h2>Better dataset support</h2>
<p>At the beginning, I designed DLL so that the user could directly pass data for
training in the form of STL Containers such as the std::vector. This is good in
some cases, but in some cases, the user does not know how to read the data , or
does not want to be bothered with it. Therefore, several data sets reader are
now available. Moreover, the entire system has been reworked to use generators
for data. A generator is simply a concept that has some data to produce. The
advantage of this new system is data augmentation is now supported every where
and much more efficiently than before. It is now possible to perform random
cropping and mirroring of images for instance. Moreover, the data augmentation
can be done in a secondary thread so as to be sure that there is always enough
data available for the training.</p>
<p>The library now has a powerful dataset reader for both MNIST and CIFAR-10 and
the reader for ImageNet is almost ready. The project has already been used and
tested with these three datasets now. Moreover, the support for directly passing
STL containers has been maintained. In this case, a generator is simply created
around the data provided in the container and the generator is then passed to
the system for training.</p>
<p>Here for instance is how to read MNIST data and scale (divide) all pixel values
by 255:</p>

<div class="section" id="much-faster-performance">
<h2>Much faster performance</h2>
<p>I've spent quite a lot of time improving the performance of the framework. I've
focused on every part of training in order to make training of neural networks
as fast as possible. I've also made a comparison of the framework against
several popular machine learning framework (Caffe, TensorFlow, Keras, Torch and
DeepLearning4J). For instance, here are the results on a small CNN experiment on
MNIST with all the different frameworks in CPU mode and in GPU mode:</p>
<img alt="DLL Comparison Against other frameworks" class="align-center" src="images/dll_comparison.png"><p>As you can see, DLL is by far the fastest framework on CPU. On GPU, there is
still some work to be done, but this is already ongoing (although a lot of work
remains). This is confirmed on each of the four experiments performed on MNIST,
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, although the margin is smaller for larger networks (still
about 40% faster than TensorFlow and Keras which are the fastest framework after
DLL on CPU on my tests).</p>
<p>Overall, DLL is between 2 and 4 times faster than before and is always the
fastest framework for neural network training when training is performed on CPU.</p>
<p>I proposed a talk about these optimizations and performance for Meeting C++ this
year, but it has unfortunately not been accepted. We also have submitted
a publication about the framework to a conference later this year.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>After all these changes, I truly feel that the library is now in a much better
state and could be useful in several projects. I hope that this will be useful
to some more people. Moreover, as you can see by the performance results, the
framework is now extremely efficient at training neural networks on CPU.</p>

<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/06/jenkins-declarative-pipeline-and-awesome-github-integration.html">my previous post</a>, I presented a few news about Jenkins and about the fact that I switched to declarative pipelines and Github Organization support for my projects.</p>
<p>The main issue I had with this system is that I lost the ability to get
notifications on build that recover. Normally, I would get an email indicating
that build X was back to normal, but I haven't found a way to solve that for
declarative pipeline.</p>
<p>By following a few posts on StackOverflow, I now have the solution and it is the
same problem that was already present in scripted pipelines. Namely, the status
of the current build is not set early enough for the notification.  Basically,
you have to set the notification yourself. Here is what a declarative pipeline
looks like:</p>

<p>There are two important things here. First, a new stage (success) is added that
simply set the result of the current build to SUCCESS once it is done. It must
be the last stage on the pipeline. This could also be added as the last step of
the last stage instead of adding a new stage, but I think it's clearer like
this. The second thing is the failure block in which the result of the current
build is set to FAILURE. With these two things, the Mailer plugin now sends
notification when a build has been fixed.</p>
<p>I hope that will help some of you. I personally think that it should be much
easier than that. All this boilerplate is polluting the pipeline that should be
kept more maintainable, but for now it seems, it's the nicest way to achieve
that, short of handling all conditions in the post block and sending mail
directly there, but that would result in even more boilerplate code.</p>

<p>This post is about some news about Jenkins and how I've updated my Jenkins
usage. This may be a bit of an enthusiastic post ;)</p>
<p>At the beginning of Jenkins, the best way to define the commands to be executed
for your builds was simply to write the commands in the Jenkins interface. This
worked quite well. Later on, Jenkins introduced the notion of Pipeline. Instead
of a single set of commands to be executed, the build was defined in
multi-stages pipeline of commands. This is defined as a Groovy script. One big
advantage of this is that all the code for creating the build is inside the
repository. This has the advantage that each build is reproducible. This enabled
to define complex pipelines of commands for your builds. Moreover, this also
allows to have a clean view of which steps are failing and which steps are
taking how much of the time of the build. For instance, here it's a view of the
pipeline steps for my DLL project:</p>
<img alt="Jenkins stage view for DLL pipeline." class="align-center" src="images/jenkins_pipeline_dll.png"><p>I think that's pretty cool :)</p>
<p>They recently added a new feature, the declarative pipelines. Instead of
scripting the Pipeline in Groovy, the new system uses its own syntax, completely
declarative, to put blocks together and add ways of doing actions at specific
points and setting environment and so on. I think the new syntax is much nicer
than the Groovy scripted Pipeline way, so I started converting my scripts. I'll
give an example in a few paragraphs. But first, I'd like to talk about Github
integration. Before, every time I created a new project, I add to add it to
Jenkins by creating a new project, updating the link to the Github project and
a few things in order to add it. This is not so bad but what if you want to
build on several branches and keep track of the status of the branches and maybe
of the Pull Requests as well. All of this is now very simple. You can now
declare the Github organizations (and users) you are of building projects from
and the projects inside the organization will be automatically detected as long
as they have a Jenkinsfile inside. That means that you'll never have to create
a project yourself or handle branches. Indeed, all the created projects can now
handle multiples. For instance, here is the status of the two current branches
of my dll project:</p>
<img alt="Jenkins branches for DLL Github project" class="align-center" src="images/jenkins_github_branches.png"><p>It's maybe not the best example since one branch is failing and the other is
unstable, but you can see that you can track the builds for each branch in
a nice way.</p>
<p>A very good feature of this integration is that Jenkins will now automatically
marks commits on your Github with the status of your builds at no cost! For
instance, here is the status on my ETL project after I configured on Jenkins and
made the first builds:</p>
<img alt="Jenkins marking commits in Github" class="align-center" src="images/jenkins_github_integration_marks.png"><p>Pretty cool I think :)</p>
<p>Another nice thing in Jenkins is the Blue Ocean interface. This is an
alternative interface, especially well-suited for multi-branch projects and
pipelines. It looks much more modern and I think it's quite good. Here are a few
views of it:</p>
<p>The Activity view for the last events of the project:</p>
<img alt="Jenkins Blue Ocean Activity view for DLL project" class="align-center" src="images/jenkins_blue_ocean_dll_activity.png"><p>The Branches view for the status of each branch:</p>
<img alt="Jenkins Blue Ocean Branches view for DLL project" class="align-center" src="images/jenkins_blue_ocean_dll_branches.png"><p>The view of the status of a build:</p>
<img alt="Jenkins Blue Ocean view of a build for DLL project" class="align-center" src="images/jenkins_blue_ocean_dll_build.png"><p>The status of the tests for a given build:</p>
<img alt="Jenkins Blue Ocean view of a build tests for DLL project" class="align-center" src="images/jenkins_blue_ocean_dll_build_tests.png"><p>It's likely that it won't appeal to everyone, but I think it's pretty nice.</p>
<p>If we get back to the declarative Pipeline, here is the declarative pipeline for
my Expression Templates Library (ETL) project:</p>

<p>There is nothing really fancy about, it's probably average. Moreover, since I'm
not an expert on pipelines and I've just discovered declarative pipelines, it
may not be optimal, but it works. As you'll see there are some problems
I haven't been able to fix.</p>
<p>The first part declares the environment variables for the build. Then, the
multiple build stages are listed. The first stage checkout the code from the
SCM. This ugly piece of code is here to allow to checkout the submodules. It is
the only solution I have found so far. It's very ugly but it works. The second
steps is simply some basic static analysis. The next step is the classical build
step. Then, the tests are run. In that case, I'm using a script because the
tests are compiled with several different sets of options and it was much easier
to put that in a script that in the Pipeline. Moreover, that also means I can
run them standalone. The variables in the line to run the script is another
problem I haven't been able to fix so far. If I declare these variables in an
environment block, they are not passed to the script for some reason, so I had
to use this ugly line. The next two blocks are for Sonar analysis. If you start
with Sonar, you can simply the second block that passed the branch information
to Sonar. Unfortunately, Sonar is very limited in terms of Git branches. Each
branch is considered as another totally different project. That means the false
positives defined in the master branch will not be used in the second branch.
Therefore, I kept a clean master and several different projects for the other
branches. Once Sonar improves this branch handling stuff, if they ever do, I'll
be able to get rid of one of these conditional stages. The last stage is simple
running the benchmark job. Finally, the post block is using the Mailer plugin to
send failed builds information. Again, there is a problem here since this does
not send "Back to normal" information as it used to do before. I've asked this
question on StackOverflow, but haven't received an answer so far. I'll post
a better solution on this blog once I have one. If any of you have some
solutions to these problems, don't hesitate to post in the comments below or to
contact me on Github.</p>
<p>Here it is. I really think Jenkins is getting even greater now with all this
cool stuff and I advice you to try it out!</p>
