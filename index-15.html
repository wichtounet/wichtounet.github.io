        <div class="e-content">
        <div><p></p><p>I'm pleased to release the version 0.5. of the EDDI Compiler.</p>
<p>This new version introduced the first version of function calls. The function can take several parameters but cannot return anything at this moment. A version of foreach loop is now available in the language.</p>
<p>You can also declare variables globally in the source code. The global variables are stored in the .data section of the ELF file and the local variables are stored on the stack.</p>
<p>The error reporting of the compiler has been improved. Indeed, now the syntactical errors are reported with the exact location of the source.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of improvements in the source code. The big header files have been splitted into several files. I replaced all the pointers by smart pointers that allowed me to remove all the memory leaks of the applications and to simplify the memory management. Finally, I started using some new features of C++11 to improve the source code of the application.</p>
<p>The next version will certainly see return types for functions and perhaps a first version of switch case. Moreover, I have a lot of improvements to do at the assembly level. Indeed, the generated assembly is not efficient at all. Perhaps, I will consider adding arrays too to this version.</p>
<p>You can find the compiler on the Github repository : <a title="EDDI COmpiler Repository" href="http://github.com/wichtounet/eddic">https://github.com/wichtounet/eddic</a>. If you watch the repository, you'll see that I followed a new branching model, the one proposed and enforced by the git-flow tool.</p>
<p>The exact version I refer to is the v0.5 available in the github tags.</p></div>

        <div><p></p><p>One week ago, I started using <strong>git-flow</strong> on eddic. This is a collection of Git extensions to easily follow a branching-model convention for a Git project. I will try to describe this project later on this blog.</p>
<p>You can install git-flow using this simple command:</p>
<p>[bash]wget --no-check-certificate -q -O - https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/raw/develop/contrib/gitflow-installer.sh | sudo sh[/bash]</p>
<p>I recommend you to install a script to autocomplete the git-flow commands and params: </p>
<p>[bash]mkdir -p ~/src/external &amp;&amp; cd ~/src/external</p>
<p>git clone https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion.git git-flow-completion</p>
<p>mkdir -p ~/bin/ &amp;&amp; cd ~/bin</p>
<p>ln -s ~/src/external/git-flow-completion/git-flow-completion.bash ./git-flow-completion.sh[/bash]</p>
<p>Then add a simple command in your .bashrc file:</p>
<p>[bash]source ~/bin/git-flow-completion.sh[/bash]</p>
<p>If you want an introduction of git-flow, I recommend you this blog post : <a href="http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/" title="Why aren't you using git-flow ?">Why aren't you using git-flow ?</a></p></div>

        <hr>
        <div class="e-content">
        <div><p></p><p>One month ago, my diploma thesis has been accepted and I got my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.</p>
<p>I made my diploma thesis at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California. I was in the team responsible of the developmenet of the ATLAS Software for the LHC in Cern. The title of my thesis is <strong>Inlining Assistance for large-scale object-oriented applications</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this project was to create a C++ analyzer to find the best functions and call sites to inline. The input of the analyzer is a call graph generated by CallGrind of the Valgrind project.</p>
<p>The functions and call sites to inline are computed using a heuristic, called the temperature. This heuristic is based on the cost of calling the given function, the frequency of calls and the size of the function. The cost of calling a function is based on the number of parameters, the virtuality of the function and the shared object the function is located in.</p>
<p>The analyzer is also able to find clusters of call sites. A cluster is a set of hot call sites related to each other. It can also finds the functions that should be moved from one library to the other or the function that should not be virtual by testing the use of each function in a class hierarchy.</p>
<p>To achieve this project, it has been necessary to study in details how a function is called on the Linux platform. The inlining optimization has also been studied to know what were the advantages and the problems of this technique.</p>
<p>To retrieve the information about the sizes and the virtuality of the function, it has been necessary to read the shared libraries and executables files. For that, we used <em>libelf</em>. The virtuality of a function is calculated by reading each virtual table and searching for the function in the virtual tables content.</p>
<p>The graph manipulation is made by the <em>Boost Graph Library</em>. As it was an advanced library, it has helped me improving my skills in specific topics like templates, traits or Template Metaprogramming.</p>
<p>The analyzer is able to run on the Linux platform on any program that has been compiled using gcc.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>We have tested the analyzer on the CLang compiler and have been able to obtain these results :</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Results.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1359" title="Results on CLang" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Results-300x203.png" alt="Results on CLang" width="300" height="203"></a></p>
<p>Cluster 1 and 2 indicates that we have inlined the first, respectively the second, cluster. Callsites_5 indicates that the first five call sites have been inlined and Functions_3 indicates that we inlined the first three functions. As we can see, the results are not really impressive, but we have only done inlining. Moreover, in some large applications, even little savings are really interesting. For example, in the ATLAS software, 1% of saving represents 100K$/year.</p>
<p>Here is the base outline of my work:</p>

        <hr>
        <div class="e-content">
        <div><p></p><p>Once <a href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2011/09/book-review-effective-c/" title="More Effective C++ Review">I finished reading Effective C++</a>, I decided to read the next one in the Effective C++ series: More Effective C++ from the same author (Scott Meyers). </p>
<p>That book follows the same model as the preceding. It seems that the entire book is made of several (35) ways to improve your C++ programs and designs. Again, the guidelines are separated into several chapters that I'll describe in the following paragraphs. </p>
<!--more-->

<p>The first chapter (Basics) talks about the references and pointers, the C++ style casts and the arrays and polymorphism together. </p>
<p>The second one (Operators) will teach you how to be wary of the user-defined conversion functions and how to distinguish between postfix and prefix version of the increment operator. You'll also learn that some operators must not be overloaden. </p>
<p>The next chapter (Exceptions) will give you a lot of advices when working with exceptions. The chapter starts by telling the reader how to avoid resource leaks when working with exception-code. It also talks about how an exception is thrown and how to catch an exception in the right way. The point of the exception specifications is also addressed here. </p>
<p>The fourth chapter (Efficiency) will give you several guidelines to improve your program's performance. You'll learn how to avoid implicit conversions or facilitate the return value optimization. Another important guideline of this chapter is about the cost of several techniques that are used in C++ like multiple inheritance of virtual functions. </p>
<p>The next chapter (Techniques) is certainly the most advanced chapter of this book. I found this chapter less interesting and more dificult to read than the others. All the guidelines are very specific like limiting the number of objects of one class, reference counting or prohibiting heap-based object. These guidelines can be interesting if you really need one of the specific presented points. </p>
<p>The last chapter (Miscellany) talks about different things to improve the way you code. For example, you'll learn how to program in the future tense and how to combine C and C++ in the same program. You'll also familiarize yourself with the language standard. </p>
<p>I liked the previous book a lot, it was very instructive and very interesting to read, almost as easy as a roman to read. For this one, I'm less convinced. Indeed, some of the guidelines are very long and hard to read. I have to say that I didn't read all of the guidelines completely. Especially in the Techniques chapter, some of the guidelines are very very long and IMHO not very interesting. Perhaps, it's just me. In fact, I'm still a beginner in C++ and perhaps some of the guidelines are just too advanced for me and that makes them boring or hard to read, I don't know, but I won't recommend this book to everyone. Before buying this book, I recommend you to read the table of contents and to see if you're interested in every guidelines that the author proposes. </p></div>

        <div class="e-content">
        <div><p></p><p>Some time ago, <a href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2011/06/book-review-accelerated-cpp/" title="Book Review : Accelerated C++">I have read Accelerated C++</a>. After this introductory book, I have chosen to read a book focused on the good practices of C++ development. On that purpose, I bought <strong>Effective C++ Third Edition</strong> from Scott Meyers. I already finished this book months ago, but I didn't found the time and the movitation to review it until now. </p>
<p>First of all, this book is aimed for people who already know C++ development and want to improve their skills in this language and especially to produce better programs and designs. This book can also be used by C developer that just switched to C++. The book is organized around 55 specific guidelines. Each guideline describe a way to write better C++. </p>
<!--more-->

<p>The guidelines are grouped into nine chapters, each of which focus a specific part of program development and design. The guidelines and the chapters are not specially made to be read in a specific order, but some of the guidelines are referring to other ones. However, I recommend that you read the guidelines in the given order, but you can also choose the guidelines or chapters that interest you the most. </p>
<p>The first chapter is an introduction of the C++ language. You will learn that C++ is not only a single language, but a multiparadigm programming language. The book will also show some errors that should be avoided when we are used to the C programming language. </p>
<p>The second chapter focuses on the constructors, the destructors and the assignment operators. Indeed, there are several rules that should be followed when declaring those things for a class, especially when talking about inheritance. For example, this chapter will teach you how and why to prevent exceptions from leaving destructors. This chapter will also talk about the copy constructors. </p>
<p>In the next chapter, you'll learn how to manage resources in the right way. You'll be introduced to the use of objects to manage a resource, to the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principle and the different forms of the new and delete operators. The point of storing newed (dynamically allocated) objects is also addressed. </p>
<p>The fourth chapter is about designs and declarations. Basically, you'll learn how to declare interfaces that are easy to use in the right way (and hard to use incorrectly, as the author says). More than just interfaces, you'll see how to treat class design as type design, so that your classes can be used like any other type in your C++ code (overlading operators is a way to achieve this goal). You'll also learn how to declare a good function signature that can be used without any problem. </p>
<p>Now that you know how to declare a good interface or a type, it's time to implement it. In the Implementation chapter, you'll see how to declare variables in the right way and how to avoid excessive casting. An important part of this chapter is the management of exceptions in your functions. Namely, you'll learn what are the different exception-safety levels for the functions and how to provide the best levels for your functions. </p>
<p>The next chapter is focused on inheritance and object-oriented design. You'll learn when and how to use inhenritance in your classes and how to avoid virtual functions when it is possible by several ways and patterns that are proposed by the author. The chapter shows also that some things are not meant to be inherited and that multiple inheritance should be used judiciously. </p>
<p>The seventh chapter talks about templates and generic programming. Compile-time polymorphisme will be addressed. After the reading of this chapter, you'll knwo how to declare and define a good function template. You'll also know how to use traits classes to get information about types at runtime. Last but not least, this chapter contains also an introduction about Template Metaprogramming (TMP). </p>
<p>The eighth chapter will teach you how customize the new and delete operators to reach your needs in memory management. This is the most specific chapters of the book and it won't be useful to everyone, but that's interesting to read it once to know what happens in the background. </p>
<p>Finally, the last chapter contains miscelleanous items, especially what libraries you should try to familiarize you with to improve your code even more or to avoid reinventing the wheel. </p>
<p>In my opinion, this book is a must-have for every beginner and medium C++ developers. All the guidelines will help you produce a better code and to avoid the most common traps that this language contains. I'm sure that after the reading of this book, your code will improve greatly. </p></div>

        <div><p></p><p>I have shown before how to <a title="Profile a C++ application with the Linux perf tools" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2011/07/profile-applications-linux-perf-tools/">profile a C++ application using the Linux perf tools</a>.  In this post, we will see how to profile the same kind of application using Callgrind. Callgrind is a tool in part of the Valgrind toolchain. It is running in Valgrind framework. The principle is not the same. When you use Callgrind to profile an application, your application is transformed in an intermediate language and then ran in a virtual processor emulated by valgrind. This has a huge run-time overhead, but the precision is really good and your profiling data is complete. An application running in Callgrind can be 10 to 50 times slower than normally.</p>
<p>The output of Callgrind is flat cal graph that is not really usable directly. In this post, we will use KCachegrind to display the informations about the profiling of the analyzed application.</p>
<!--more-->

<p></p><h4>Installation</h4>
<p>First of all, you need to install Callgrind and KCachegrind. You also need to install graphviz in order to view the call graph in KCachegrind. The applications are already packaged for the most important Linux distributions. You can just use apt-get to install them:</p>
<p>[bash]sudo apt-get install valgrind kcachegrind graphviz[/bash]</p>
<p>or aptitude:</p>
<p>[bash]sudo aptitude install valgrind kcachegrind graphviz[/bash]</p>
<p>or whatever your favourite package manager is.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>We have to start by profiling the application with Callgrind. To profile an application with Callgrind, you just have to prepend the Callgrind invocation in front of your normal program invocation:</p>
<p>[bash]valgrind --tool=callgrind program [program_options][/bash]</p>
<p>The result will be stored in a callgrind.out.XXX file where XXX will be the process identifier. </p>
<p>You can read this file using a text editor, but it won't be very useful because it's very cryptic. That's here that KCacheGrind will be useful. You can launch KCacheGrind using command line or in the program menu if your system installed it here. Then, you have to open your profile file. </p>
<p>The first view present a list of all the profiled functions. You can see the inclusive and the self cost of each function and the location of each one. </p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2011/09/first-view2.png"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2011/09/first-view2-300x212.png" alt="" title="List of functions" width="300" height="212" class="size-medium wp-image-1322"></a></p>
<p>Once you click on a function, the other views are filled with information. The view in uppper right part of the window gives some information about the selected function. </p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2011/09/second-view.png"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2011/09/second-view-300x166.png" alt="Information about the function" title="Information about the function" width="300" height="166" class="size-medium wp-image-1323"></a></p>
<p>The view have several tabs presenting different information: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Types : Present the types of events that have been recorded. In our case, it's not really interesting, it's just the number of instructions fetch</li>
    <li>Callers : List of the direct callers</li>
    <li>All Callers : List of all the callers, it seems the callers and the callers of the callers</li>
    <li>Callee Map : A map of the callee, personally, I do not really understand this view, but it's a kind of call graph representing the cost of the functions</li>
    <li>Source code : The source code of the function if the application has been compiled with the debug symbol</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, you have another view with data about the selected function. </p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2011/09/third-view.png"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2011/09/third-view-300x208.png" alt="Information about the function" title="Information about the function" width="300" height="208" class="size-medium wp-image-1324"></a></p>
<p>Again, several tabs: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Callees : The direct callees of the function</li>
    <li>Call Graph : The call graph from the function to the end</li>
    <li>All Callees : All the callees and the callees of the callees</li>
    <li>Caller Map : The map of the caller, again not really understandable for me</li>
    <li>Machine Code : The machine code of the function if the application has been profiled with --dump-instr=yes option</li>
</ul>

<p>You have also several display options and filter features to find exactly what you want and display it the way you want. </p>
<p>The information provided by KCacheGrind can be very useful to find which functions takes too much time or which functions are called too much. </p>
<p>I hope this article will be useful. </p></div>

        <div><p></p><p>CCCC (C and C++ Code Counter) is a little command-line tool that generates metrics from the source code of a C or C++ project. The output of the tool is a simple HTML website with information about all your sources.</p>
<p>CCCC generates not only information about the number of lines of codes for each of your modules, but also complexity metrics like the McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity level of your modules and functions, design metrics like the coupling between the modules or object oriented metrics like the depth of inheritance tree for each of your classes, ...</p>
<!--more-->

<p></p><h4>Installation</h4>
<p>On some Linux systems, cccc is already packaged, so you just have to use your favourite package manager to install it. On Ubuntu, I used :</p>
<p>[bash]sudo apt-get install cccc[/bash]</p>
<p>to install it. If the tool is not packaged for your system, you can download it <a title="CCCC SourceForge page" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cccc/" target="_blank">here</a>. Then, you have run the build script :</p>
<p>[bash]sh build_posixgcc.sh[/bash]</p>
<p>and you will find a <em>cccc</em> executable in the <em>cccc</em> folder. You can just put the executable in your path or use it using the absolute path. </p>
<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>The usage of the tool is really easy. You just have to invoke it passing all the sources files you want to parse as arguments. For example: </p>
<p>[bash]cccc src/<em>.cpp include/</em>.hpp[/bash]</p>
<p>And the site will be generated in a <em>.cccc</em> folder in the current folder. You can also specify the output directory using the <em>--outdir=folder</em> option. </p>
<p>The main entry of the HTML generated website is the <em>cccc.html</em> file. As an example, I uploaded the metrics of the compiler of the EDDI language <a href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/cccc/eddic/cccc.html" title="Metrics for the EDDI Compiler" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>You can find more information about the tool on the official website : <a href="http://cccc.sourceforge.net/" title="Official website of the CCCC project" target="_blank">http://cccc.sourceforge.net/</a></p></div>

        <div><p></p><p>Five years after Java 6, Oracle has just released Java 7!</p>
<p>This is the first release of Java since Oracle bought Sun Microsystems.</p>
<p>This new version of Java introduces a lot of new features, but some of the languages new features will be introduced in Java 8 <a title="Java 7 delays and Plan B" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/09/java-7-delays-and-plan-b/">as stated by the "Plan B"</a>.</p>
<p>In this version, there some great new language features, as stated by the JSR 334 :</p>
<p></p><ul>
    <li>Strings in switch</li>
    <li>Binary integral literals and underscores in numeric literals</li>
    <li><a title="Better exception handling in Java 7 : Multicatch and precise rethrow" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/05/better-exception-handling-in-java-7-multicatch-and-final-rethrow/">Multi-catch and more precise rethrow</a></li>
    <li>Improved Type Inference for Generic Instance Creation (diamond)</li>
    <li><a title="Java 7 : try with resources statement" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/08/java-7-try-with-resources-statement/">try-with-resources statement</a></li>
    <li>Simplified Varargs Method Invocation</li>
</ul>
<div>We will also see <a title="Java 7 : New I/O Features with NIO.2" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/04/java-7-new-io-features-asynchronous-operations-multicasting-random-access-with-jsr-203-nio-2/">the new NIO.2 API </a>(specified by the JSR 203).</div>

<p>A new bytecode instruction has been added to the virtual machine, <a title="Java 7 : More dynamics" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/04/java-7-more-dynamics/">InvokeDynamic</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a title="Download Java 7 on Oracle website" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">download Java SE 7</a> on the Oracle website.</p>
<p>I think it was time now for Java to have a new version with some refreshing, and it's IMO a good new version that we have now. I just hope that the next version,  Java 8, will be here in less than five years to <a title="Oracle pushes a first version of the closures" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/05/oracle-pushes-a-first-version-of-closures/">give us the closures</a>.</p></div>
