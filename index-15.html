<p>I'm pleased to release the version 0.5. of the EDDI Compiler.</p>
<p>This new version introduced the first version of function calls. The function can take several parameters but cannot return anything at this moment. A version of foreach loop is now available in the language.</p>
<p>You can also declare variables globally in the source code. The global variables are stored in the .data section of the ELF file and the local variables are stored on the stack.</p>
<p>The error reporting of the compiler has been improved. Indeed, now the syntactical errors are reported with the exact location of the source.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of improvements in the source code. The big header files have been splitted into several files. I replaced all the pointers by smart pointers that allowed me to remove all the memory leaks of the applications and to simplify the memory management. Finally, I started using some new features of C++11 to improve the source code of the application.</p>
<p>The next version will certainly see return types for functions and perhaps a first version of switch case. Moreover, I have a lot of improvements to do at the assembly level. Indeed, the generated assembly is not efficient at all. Perhaps, I will consider adding arrays too to this version.</p>
<p>You can find the compiler on the Github repository : <a title="EDDI COmpiler Repository" href="http://github.com/wichtounet/eddic">https://github.com/wichtounet/eddic</a>. If you watch the repository, you'll see that I followed a new branching model, the one proposed and enforced by the git-flow tool.</p>
<p>The exact version I refer to is the v0.5 available in the github tags.</p>

<p>One week ago, I started using <strong>git-flow</strong> on eddic. This is a collection of Git extensions to easily follow a branching-model convention for a Git project. I will try to describe this project later on this blog.</p>
<p>You can install git-flow using this simple command:</p>
<pre>wget --no-check-certificate -q -O - https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/raw/develop/contrib/gitflow-installer.sh | sudo sh</pre>

<p>I recommend you to install a script to autocomplete the git-flow commands and params: </p>
<pre>mkdir -p ~/src/external &amp;&amp; cd ~/src/external
git clone https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion.git git-flow-completion
mkdir -p ~/bin/ &amp;&amp; cd ~/bin
ln -s ~/src/external/git-flow-completion/git-flow-completion.bash ./git-flow-completion.sh</pre>

<p>Then add a simple command in your .bashrc file:</p>
<pre>source ~/bin/git-flow-completion.sh</pre>

<p>If you want an introduction of git-flow, I recommend you this blog post : <a href="http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/" title="Why aren't you using git-flow ?">Why aren't you using git-flow ?</a></p>

<p>One month ago, my diploma thesis has been accepted and I got my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.</p>
<p>I made my diploma thesis at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California. I was in the team responsible of the developmenet of the ATLAS Software for the LHC in Cern. The title of my thesis is <strong>Inlining Assistance for large-scale object-oriented applications</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this project was to create a C++ analyzer to find the best functions and call sites to inline. The input of the analyzer is a call graph generated by CallGrind of the Valgrind project.</p>
<p>The functions and call sites to inline are computed using a heuristic, called the temperature. This heuristic is based on the cost of calling the given function, the frequency of calls and the size of the function. The cost of calling a function is based on the number of parameters, the virtuality of the function and the shared object the function is located in.</p>
<p>The analyzer is also able to find clusters of call sites. A cluster is a set of hot call sites related to each other. It can also finds the functions that should be moved from one library to the other or the function that should not be virtual by testing the use of each function in a class hierarchy.</p>
<p>To achieve this project, it has been necessary to study in details how a function is called on the Linux platform. The inlining optimization has also been studied to know what were the advantages and the problems of this technique.</p>
<p>To retrieve the information about the sizes and the virtuality of the function, it has been necessary to read the shared libraries and executables files. For that, we used <em>libelf</em>. The virtuality of a function is calculated by reading each virtual table and searching for the function in the virtual tables content.</p>
<p>The graph manipulation is made by the <em>Boost Graph Library</em>. As it was an advanced library, it has helped me improving my skills in specific topics like templates, traits or Template Metaprogramming.</p>
<p>The analyzer is able to run on the Linux platform on any program that has been compiled using gcc.</p>

After this introductory book, I have chosen to read a book focused on the good practices of C++ development. On that purpose, I bought <strong>Effective C++ Third Edition</strong> from Scott Meyers. I already finished this book months ago, but I didn't found the time and the movitation to review it until now. </p>
<p>First of all, this book is aimed for people who already know C++ development and want to improve their skills in this language and especially to produce better programs and designs. This book can also be used by C developer that just switched to C++. The book is organized around 55 specific guidelines. Each guideline describe a way to write better C++. </p>

<p>I have shown before how to <a title="Profile a C++ application with the Linux perf tools" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2011/07/profile-applications-linux-perf-tools/">profile a C++ application using the Linux perf tools</a>.  In this post, we will see how to profile the same kind of application using Callgrind. Callgrind is a tool in part of the Valgrind toolchain. It is running in Valgrind framework. The principle is not the same. When you use Callgrind to profile an application, your application is transformed in an intermediate language and then ran in a virtual processor emulated by valgrind. This has a huge run-time overhead, but the precision is really good and your profiling data is complete. An application running in Callgrind can be 10 to 50 times slower than normally.</p>
<p>The output of Callgrind is flat cal graph that is not really usable directly. In this post, we will use KCachegrind to display the informations about the profiling of the analyzed application.</p>

<p>Five years after Java 6, Oracle has just released Java 7!</p>
<p>This is the first release of Java since Oracle bought Sun Microsystems.</p>
<p>This new version of Java introduces a lot of new features, but some of the languages new features will be introduced in Java 8 <a title="Java 7 delays and Plan B" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/09/java-7-delays-and-plan-b/">as stated by the "Plan B"</a>.</p>
<p>In this version, there some great new language features, as stated by the JSR 334 :</p>
<ul>
