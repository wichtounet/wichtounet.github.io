Use tx3TagCloud to render our tags in a pretty web:

 * https://github.com/Tuxes3/tx3TagCloud

**YOU HAVE TO COPY** the template
`tx3_tag_cloud/templates/mako/tags.tmpl` in your THEME folder to make
it work properly. This templates includes the JS and CSS files needed
to render tx3TagCloud and also removes the tags rendered in the old
way.

Something like: `<your-nikola-site>/themes/<your-theme>/templates/`
