<p><html><body><p>My name is Baptiste Wicht and I'm now 24 years old. I’m currently a Master student in Computer Science at the University of applied sciences in Fribourg. I've been programming in Java for four years and also learned PHP/MySQL at my school.</p>
<p>I’ve been active in Developpez.com, a french computer science community, for more than three years. At first, I went there to ask for help about my programming problems and almost always found solutions. Then, Java responsible asked me to moderate the Java forums. After that, I started to write Java tutorials. I started with a tutorial explaining the creation of GUI with Swing. Then, I continued with an article about a simple Java update system and later wrote a lot of other articles in several categories. And after that, I was one of the two Java Community Leaders on Developpez.com. Now, I have left these responsibilities to write this blog.</p>
<p>One year ago, I started C++ for my Bachelor project and since this time wrote several projects in C++ and do my best to improve my skills with this language and its libraries.</p>
<p>It hasn't been very long since I started writing articles and tutorials in English, but I do my best to have a good writing level. If you find errors, don’t hesitate to contact me.</p>
