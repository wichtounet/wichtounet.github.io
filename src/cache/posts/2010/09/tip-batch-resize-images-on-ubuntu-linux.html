<p><html><body><p>After needing to <a href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/07/tip-optimize-images-on-ubuntu-linux/" target="_blank">optimize a lot of images at once</a>, this weekend I needed to resize a lot of images to the same size because they were too big.</p>
<p>Like every other thing in Linux, there is a really simple tool to automate that. I used imagemagick to do that. Of course, there is certainly a lot of other things to make that work, but this is the first I've found and it works well.</p>
<p>So first, you need to install it if you don't have the tool :</p>
<p></p><pre>sudo apt-get install imagemagick</pre></p>
<p>And then, you can resize all the JPG images to a width of 640px of the current folder using the single command :</p>
<pre>mogrify -resize 640 *.jpg</pre>

<p>If you want the height, just add a x :</p>
<pre>mogrify -resize x640 *.jpg</pre>

<p>You can also specify maximum width and height, that can be useful if you have big images and you don't want a width larger than x and a height larger than y but you don't want to resize little images in the same folder. Here is an example resizing images if the width is larger than 1280 or height larger than 1024 :</p>
<pre>mogrify -resize '1280x1024&gt;' *.jpg</pre>

<p>With all that commands, the ratio is preserved. If you want more informations on the possible resize options, you can consult the <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/www/command-line-processing.html#geometry" target="_blank">documentation of ImageMagick</a>.</p>
<p>Hope that will help someone.</body></html></p>
