<p><html><body><p>When you makes a lot of build using <strong>Maven</strong>, this is quickly a pain to wait for the end of the build. So this is always good to have solutions to improve the <strong>performances</strong> of the builds.</p>
<p>The better improvement i found until now is the <strong>maven-cli-plugin</strong>. This plugin provides an <strong>interactive command line</strong> interface to launch builds. The improvement is that the first phases of the build are made only once. So multiple builds are really <strong>faster</strong>. We loose a little time at the first build to make some <strong>caching</strong> improvements.</p>
<p>With these features, I save a lot of time when I made a lot of builds. For example a simple clean takes sometimes 20 seconds on a big multimodule project. When using the cli, it takes 20 seconds including the time to load the shell for the first time and then it takes only 1 second the make the following cleans. The effect is the same on other phases like install, package, compile, ...</p>
<p>The installation is quite simple. First you must add a plugin group to the settings.xml file :</p>
<p>[xml]&lt;settings&gt;
  &lt;pluginGroups&gt;
    &lt;pluginGroup&gt;org.twdata.maven&lt;/pluginGroup&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/pluginGroups&gt;
  ...
&lt;/settings&gt;[/xml]</p>
<p>And then add a new repository for the manve-cli-plugin : </p>
<p>[xml]&lt;pluginRepositories&gt;
     &lt;pluginRepository&gt;
          &lt;id&gt;twdata-m2-repository&lt;/id&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;twdata.org Maven 2 Repository&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;url&gt;http://twdata-m2-repository.googlecode.com/svn/&lt;/url&gt;
     &lt;/pluginRepository&gt;
&lt;/pluginRepositories&gt;[/xml]</p>
<p>And you just have to use the following command on a Maven project : </p>
<p></p><pre>mvn cli:execute-phase</pre></p>
<p>With that the plugin will be downloaded automatically and the next commands will be executed directly. </p>
<p>The usage is very easy. This plugin has 2 useful goals : </p>
<ul>
    <li>execute : Open a shell and allows you to execute goals of plugins. </li>
    <li>execute-phase : Open a shell and allows you to execute phases of the maven build. </li>
</ul>

<p>The main difference is that if you launch install from the execute-phase, all the preceding phases will be executed, but that's not the case with execute, only install will be executed. </p>
<p>Personally, I only execute phases, so I always use the execute-phase of the cli plugin. </p>
<p>When you're in the shell, you can launch several phases or goals : </p>
<pre>maven&gt; clean install</pre>

<p>And you can directly add arguments in the command : </p>
<pre>maven&gt; clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true</pre>

<p>And when you are building a multimodule projects, you can also execute phases only on several modules : </p>
<pre>maven&gt; module1 module2 module3 clean install</pre>

<p>You can use the ls command in a multi module project to list all the modules of the project. You can use the "Tab" key to auto complete the goals, phases and modules name. </p>
<p>When you've finished your builds, you can simply use the "exit" command to exit from the command line. </p>
<p>I think it's really a great essential plugin for each person who make Maven builds.  </p>
