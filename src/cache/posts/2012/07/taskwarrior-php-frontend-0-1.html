<p><html><body><p>I released the version 0.1 of <strong>taskwarrior-php</strong>.</p>
<p>This project is a simple PHP Frontend for Taskwarrior. For now, the frontend is quite basic. All the tasks are displayed and sorted by projects. The completion of each project is also computed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/?attachment_id=2035" rel="attachment wp-att-2035"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2035" title="taskwarrior-php Screenshot" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/taskwarrior-php-1-300x271.png" alt="taskwarrior-php Screenshot" width="300" height="271"></a> taskwarrior-php Screenshot</p>
<p>You can also insert a new task. For now, only the project and the description of the task can be modified.</p>
<p></p><h2>Download</h2></p>
<p>The application is available on the Git repository :Â <a href="https://github.com/wichtounet/taskwarrior-php">https://github.com/wichtounet/taskwarrior-php</a></p>
<p>The installation is simple, you just have to put all the files in a folder of a PHP server. Then, you have to edit the config.php to set the location of your Taskwarrior files.</p>
<p>It is necessary that the Taskwarrior files are on the PHP server as well. For that, you can use the FTP pull and push commands of Taskwarrior.</p>
<p>Don't hesitate to contact me if you have some ideas for this project or if you find some bugs.</body></html></p>
