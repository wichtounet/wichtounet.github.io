<p><html><body><p>Only three days after the 0.8 version, I finished the 0.8.1 version.</p>
<p>It's a minor version, so there is no big changes to the language. However, I added support for the <strong>do while loop</strong> in the source code.</p>
<p>Another change is that assignment is now returning a value. That allows you to make some code like this one:</p>
<p>[cpp]int a = b = 5;</p>
<p>b = (a = 4) + 1;[/cpp]</p>
<p>This new version includes also some new changes for the optimization engine. I implemented <strong>constant propagation</strong> and <strong>copy propagation</strong> for offset assignment. For example:</p>
<p>[cpp]a(8) = 4;</p>
<p>b = a(8);[/cpp]</p>
<p>becomes:</p>
<p>[cpp]a(8) = 4;</p>
<p>b = 4;[/cpp]</p>
<p>And the last change is that the concatenations that are detected to be constant after some optimization are made at compile-time by the optimization engine. This simplify a lot the generated code for source file with a lot of concatenations.</p>
<p>The next version (the 0.9) will introduce floating point operations and parameter passing with registers (probably only in 64 bit). It's also possible that I will try to implement a first version of global optimization.</p>
