<p><html><body><p>Hi,</p>
<p>From several days, I started developing with Sharepoint 2010 for a School project. It's not as easy as I thought in my first opinion. So I will try to share some solutions I found with you</p>
<p>In Sharepoint 2007, we used Solution Generator to create a wsp file of the site and then we can use this wsp file in Visual Studio for example.</p>
<p>But in Sharepoint 2010, you can do it directly in the site administration. Go in Site Settings -&gt; Site action and then choose "Save site as template". Then, you just have to provide a name and description and you can save Â the template.</p>
<p>In the next view, you have a link to the Solution gallery. Go in this view and then click on your template and you can download the .wsp file.</p>
<p>In some cases, we can have some problems during export... Try to create a blank site et add only the things you want to export and then retry.</p>
<p>When you've the wsp file, you can import it in Visual Studio 2010 using New Project -&gt; Import Sharepoint Solution Package. This can take a lot of time to import all the content of the package.</p>
<p>With that, you can create things in Sharepoint and then use and edit them in Visual Studio.</p>
<p>I hope this can be useful to someone.</p></body></html></p>
