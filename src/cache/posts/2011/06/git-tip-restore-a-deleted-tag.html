<p>If you juste deleted a tag by error, you can easily restore it following these steps. First, use</p>
<p></p><pre>git fsck --unreachable | grep tag</pre></p>
<p>then, you will see the unreachable tag. If you have several tags on the list, use </p>
<pre>git show KEY</pre>

<p>to found the good tag and finally, when you know which tag to restore, use</p>
<pre>git update-ref refs/tags/NAME KEY</pre>

<p>and the previously deleted tag with restore with NAME. </p>
