<p>This new version allows the use of integers. You can declare int variables and pass int values or variables to the Print operation. </p>
<p>I've also refactored the compiled to use a kind of parse tree and several phases. But now, I'm not really satisfied with the design. The classes are too strongly coupled and the parse tree is too specific I think, too many assumptions are made during the semantical analysis. But now, I don't know how to improve that. I also think that the design and the operations will not support some more advanced adds later, I don't know... Don't hesitate if you have any idea or comment on the design :)</p>
<p>I've also made some changes to the Lexer in order to improve the performances, but nothing spectacular. </p>
<p>You can now compile this kind of code with Eddi : </p>
<p>[cpp]int a = 1;</p>
<p>string b = "asdf";</p>
<p>Print(1);</p>
<p>Print("Test");</p>
<p>Print(a);</p>
<p>Print(b);</p>
<p>b = "new b";</p>
<p>Prinb(b);[/cpp]</p>
<p>The next changes will be to add operations on int and perhaps also the concat on two stirngs. I will see. I will also try to improve the design of the compiler if I found some ideas. </p>
