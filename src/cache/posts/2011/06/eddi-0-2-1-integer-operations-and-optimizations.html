<p><html><body><p>I've introduced a new feature in EDDI. You can now make computations on integers and string concatenations. </p>
<p>So you can now write this kind of thing with EDDI : </p>
<p>[cpp]int i = 4 + 2 * 2;</p>
<p>int j = i + 5 % 6 / 3 * 4;</p>
<p>Print(i + 2);</p>
<p>Print(j % i);[/cpp]</p>
<p>Adding computations has not been very difficult. The difficult thing has been to find a way to mange operators priorities. For now, I'm not really satisfied with the result, but it works. I will try to think of another way to make that in the future. </p>
<p>I've also introduced the first compile-time optimizations. When a computation is known to be constant a compile time, the computation is directly replaced with its result. </p>
<p>The next step will be to introduce branches and loops. </p>
