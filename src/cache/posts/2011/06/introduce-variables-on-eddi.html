<p><html><body><p>The version 0.1.1 of EDDI is now available. </p>
<p>This new version introduce the feature to put variable on the code. You can now write things like that : </p>
<p>[cpp]a = "Variable a";</p>
<p>b = "Variable b";</p>
<p>Print(a);</p>
<p>Print(b);[/cpp]</p>
<p>And you can also reassign value to a variable and assign the value of a variable to another : </p>
<p>[cpp]a = b;</p>
<p>b = "New variable b";[/cpp]</p>
<p>Nothing extraordinary, but it's a start. The variable name are compiled into integers and a table of variable has been made on the virtual machine. </p>
<p>The last step will be to introduce a new type : the integers. But for this integration, I'm not exactly sure on how to do that. I will certainly create a string pool and put only references to the strings on the stack, but it's not clearly defined. Don't hesitate if you have any comment :)</p>
<p>The project is available on Github : </p>
