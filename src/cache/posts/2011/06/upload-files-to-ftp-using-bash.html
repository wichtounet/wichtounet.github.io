<p><html><body><p>This morning, I wanted to automatically update a little website from my computer without using Filezilla. So I searched a little bit and found that there is a very useful tool called <a href="http://www.ncftp.com/">nftp</a>. To install it, you only have to use apt-get : </p>
<p>[bash]sudo apt-get install ncftp[/bash]</p>
<p>This tool can be used directly from bash to upload files to FTP (and also to get files of course). </p>
<p>In my case, I just have to put a complete hierarchy of files into a specific folder of my website. So I wrote a little script that put everything on the FTP server : </p>
<p>[bash]read -s -p "Enter Password: " mypassword</p>
<p>ncftp &lt;&lt;EOF</p>
<p>open -u username -p $mypassword yoursitehost</p>
<p>cd "folder on the website"</p>
<p>lcd "folder on the computer"</p>
<p>put -R *</p>
<p>bye</p>
<p>EOF[/bash]</p>
<p>This script asks you your password. With that, you don't have to put it in clear inside your program. The most important command here is the put -R * that make a recursive upload of the current folder in the current remote folder. </p>
<p>If I launch it from my computer (using the good values of course), it gives me that : </p>

<p>You will see the current status of all the files during the upload. The tool is enough smart to detect if a file must be sent or not (so it upload only newer files). </p>
<p>I hope this can help some of you. </body></html></p>
