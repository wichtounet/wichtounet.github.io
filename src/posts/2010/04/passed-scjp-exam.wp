I'm happy to say that I passed the Sun Certified Java Programmer for Java SE 6.0 this morning :)

I passed the exam with 93%. I'm really happy of my score. 

To prepare this exam, I read the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/SCJP-Certified-Programmer-Java-310-065/dp/0071591060/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1270728614&amp;sr=1-2">SCJP Sun Certified Programmer for Java 6 Exam 310-065</a> and exercise the chapters for which I wasn't good enough. 

So i started my exam this morning at 8.30 (Switzerland time) and after 2 hours of work, I was happy to see my score and to rest my poor brain. 

So now i'm waiting of the certificate sended by post.
