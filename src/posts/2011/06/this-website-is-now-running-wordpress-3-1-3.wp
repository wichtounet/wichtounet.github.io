I just made the update of this website to WordPress 3.1.3. 

I've had no problems with the update. But at the start the automatic updater throws me an Out Of Memory Error. But after disabling all my plugins, the automatic update had no problem to update my entire website without any errors :)

Don't hesitate to contact me (in the comments or via the contact form) if you found any problem on the website.
