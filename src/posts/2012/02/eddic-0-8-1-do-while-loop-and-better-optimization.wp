Only three days after the 0.8 version, I finished the 0.8.1 version.

It's a minor version, so there is no big changes to the language. However, I added support for the <strong>do while loop</strong> in the source code.

Another change is that assignment is now returning a value. That allows you to make some code like this one:

```cpp
int a = b = 5;
b = (a = 4) + 1;
```

This new version includes also some new changes for the optimization engine. I implemented <strong>constant propagation</strong> and <strong>copy propagation</strong> for offset assignment. For example:

```cpp
a(8) = 4;
b = a(8);
```

becomes:

```cpp
a(8) = 4;
b = 4;
```

And the last change is that the concatenations that are detected to be constant after some optimization are made at compile-time by the optimization engine. This simplify a lot the generated code for source file with a lot of concatenations.

The next version (the 0.9) will introduce floating point operations and parameter passing with registers (probably only in 64 bit). It's also possible that I will try to implement a first version of global optimization.
