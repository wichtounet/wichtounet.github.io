<p>I've just released a new version of my command-line budget manager:
budgetwarrior 0.4.</p>
<div class="section" id="enhanced-aggregate-overview">
<h1>Enhanced aggregate overview</h1>
<p>The aggregate overviews have been greatly improved. First, there is now a
<em>budget overview month</em> command that groups all expenses of amonth together.
Here is a possible output:</p>
<img alt="/images/budget_04_aggregate_month.png" src="/images/budget_04_aggregate_month.png" />
<p>It also possible to use <em>--full</em> option to also aggregate together the different
accounts:</p>
<img alt="/images/budget_04_aggregate_month_full.png" src="/images/budget_04_aggregate_month_full.png" />
<p>Another new option is <em>--no-group</em> that disables the grouping by categories:</p>
<img alt="/images/budget_04_aggregate_month_full_ng.png" src="/images/budget_04_aggregate_month_full_ng.png" />
<p>Moreover, the separator of categories can now be configured with <em>--separator=</em>.</p>
<p>All these options can also be set in the configuration with these options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>aggregate_full : If set to true, does the same as the --full option.</li>
<li>aggregate_no_group : If set to true, does the same as the --no-group option.</li>
<li>aggregate_separator : Sets the separator for grouping.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enhanced-wish-list">
<h1>Enhanced wish list</h1>
<p>The wishes management has also been improved.</p>
<p>First, each wish can now be set an Urgency and Importance level. This is now
shown in wish status as simple indicators:</p>
<img alt="/images/budget_04_wish_status.png" src="/images/budget_04_wish_status.png" />
<p>Moreover, the accuracy of the estimation compared to the paid amount is shown in
<em>wish list</em>:</p>
