<p>In the last month, I've developped a very simple tool in Python: <em>pm</em>. This tool
allows to check the status of all the Git repositories inside a repository. I've
just released the first version of this tool: pm-0.1.1</p>
<p>Those who are following this blog will perhaps wonder why Python and not C++ :)
The reason is quite simple, I wanted to improve my skills in Python. And what is
better than to develop a project from scratch.</p>
<div class="section" id="features">
<h1>Features</h1>
<p>The main feature of this application is to show the status of every projects in
a directory. The status of your projects can be queried by using <code>pm
status</code>. On my computer this gives something like that:</p>
<img alt="/images/pm_status.png" src="/images/pm_status.png" />
<p>The state of each branch of each project is shown. There different possible
status (they are cumulative):
* Behind remote: Commits are available on the remote repository
* Ahead of remote: Some local commits are no pushed
* Diverged: Behind and Ahead
* Uncomitted changes: Some changes are not committed
* Clean: Indicates that everything is committed, pushed and pull.</p>
<p>By default, the directory is ~/dev/ but you can change it by passing the
repository to the command, if you pass a relative directory, it will be relative
to home. For instance, here is the status of my doc repositories:</p>
<img alt="/images/pm_status_2.png" src="/images/pm_status_2.png" />
<p>Another feature that can be useful is that it is able to check the status of
submodules with the -s option:</p>
<img alt="/images/pm_status_sm.png" src="/images/pm_status_sm.png" />
<p>As you can see it supports recursive submodules. For each submodule it will
indicate if there are new commits available or not.</p>
<p>pm is not only able to show status of the projects, it can also fetch the status
of branches from remote by using <code>pm fetch</code>. All the remote branches are
fetched from remote. It can also automatically update the projects that are
behind remote (equivalent of git pull) with <code>pm update</code>. Only projects
that can be fast-forwarded are updated.</p>

<div class="section" id="installation">
<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>Thanks to <em>pip</em>, installation of pm is quite simple:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
pip install pm
</pre>
<p>If you don't want to use pip, you can install it by hand:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
wget https://github.com/wichtounet/pm/archive/0.1.1.tar.gz
tar xf 0.1.1.tar.gz
cd 0.1.1
python setup.py install
</pre>
<p>For those interested, source code is available <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/pm">on Github</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestion for the tool or on the source code, post a comment to
