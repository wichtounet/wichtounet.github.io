<p>At my school, I gave a short presentation about Deep Learning and the
implementation I made in C++.</p>
<p>It is nothing fancy, but it could be interesting to someone.</p>

<p>The implementation is here: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/dll">https://github.com/wichtounet/dll</a></p>
