<p>In behalf of my school (College of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg), I
presented a shoft presentation about Software Reliability. In this presentation,
I outline the main issues about the subject and propose some solutions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Software Validation</li>
<li>Defensive Programming</li>
<li>Software Analysis Tools</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Software Analysis Tools, I present three tools: cppcheck, Valgrind and
the Clang Static analyzer. Several examples are presented for each tools as well
as some recommendations for using them. A short presentation of SonarQube is
also performed.</p>
<p>I thought that it could be of some interest to some of the readers, so here it
is:</p>

<p>The source code for the examples is available <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/analysis-examples">on Github</a>.</p>
