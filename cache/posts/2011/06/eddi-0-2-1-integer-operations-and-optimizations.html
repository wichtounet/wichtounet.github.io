<p>I've introduced a new feature in EDDI. You can now make computations on integers and string concatenations. </p>
<p>So you can now write this kind of thing with EDDI : </p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">j</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">6</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">Print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">Print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">j</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre>


<p>Adding computations has not been very difficult. The difficult thing has been to find a way to mange operators priorities. For now, I'm not really satisfied with the result, but it works. I will try to think of another way to make that in the future. </p>
<p>I've also introduced the first compile-time optimizations. When a computation is known to be constant a compile time, the computation is directly replaced with its result. </p>
<p>The next step will be to introduce branches and loops. </p>
