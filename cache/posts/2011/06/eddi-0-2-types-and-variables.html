<p>I just pushed the last commits of Eddi 0.2. </p>
<p>This new version allows the use of integers. You can declare int variables and pass int values or variables to the Print operation. </p>
<p>I've also refactored the compiled to use a kind of parse tree and several phases. But now, I'm not really satisfied with the design. The classes are too strongly coupled and the parse tree is too specific I think, too many assumptions are made during the semantical analysis. But now, I don't know how to improve that. I also think that the design and the operations will not support some more advanced adds later, I don't know... Don't hesitate if you have any idea or comment on the design :)</p>
<p>I've also made some changes to the Lexer in order to improve the performances, but nothing spectacular. </p>
<p>You can now compile this kind of code with Eddi : </p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;asdf&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">Print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">Print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Test&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">Print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">Print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;new b&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">Prinb</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre>


<p>The next changes will be to add operations on int and perhaps also the concat on two stirngs. I will see. I will also try to improve the design of the compiler if I found some ideas. </p>
