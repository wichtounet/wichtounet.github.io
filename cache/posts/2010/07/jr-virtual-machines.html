<p>Until now, we've always had concurrent program working in one virtual machines, but JR provides ways to declare several virtual machines on several different physical machines. A JR Virtual Machine contains a Java Virtual Machine and a layer for the JR language. Once you created some virtual machines, you can specify where an object will be created with a variant of the new operator. After that, almost all the development is transparent. By example,  a send operation on an operation serviced by an other virtual machine is exactly the same as if there is only one virtual machine. You can do exactly the same thing. We'll see that there is some differences, but it's really easy.</p>
<p>An important thing to remember is that all the virtual machines created contains the static part of the application. So all the static part is local to the virtual machines. This can cause really difficult bug to solve if we don't take care.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>So, now that we know the basis of the virtual machines, let's create a new virtual machine :</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">vm</span> <span class="n">vm1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">vm</span><span class="o">();</span>
</pre>


<p>That will create a new virtual machine, named vm1, on the same physical machine where the code is executed. You can also choose to create a virtual machine on an other machine :</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">vm</span> <span class="n">vm2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">wm</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="s">&quot;192.168.1.200&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="c1">//IP Adresse of the machine</span>
<span class="n">vm</span> <span class="n">vm3</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">wm</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="s">&quot;pc12&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="c1">//Name of the machine</span>
<span class="n">vm</span> <span class="n">vm4</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">vm</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="n">vm3</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="c1">//The machine where vm3 is located</span>
</pre>


<p>To create a virtual machine on an other machine, you need to right to connect to that computer with ssh or csh without any password. For more informations, the best is to read <a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~olsson/research/jr/versions/2.00602/install.html">the official installation guide</a>. </p>
<p>JR provide no way to destroy a virtual machine. Like any other objects, a vm became garbage collected when there is no reference to it and when the virtual machine is idle (all the processes are over or blocked).</p>
<p>If you want to place an object on a virtual machine, you must define it with the remote keyword :</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">remote</span> <span class="n">Person</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">remote</span> <span class="n">Person</span><span class="o">();</span>
</pre>


<p>By default, the object is created on the same virtual machine where the code is executed, but you can put it in an other virtual machines :</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">remote</span> <span class="n">Person</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">remote</span> <span class="n">Person</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="n">vm1</span><span class="o">;</span>
</pre>


<p>You can also combine the creation of virtual machine and remote objects in one line :</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">remote</span> <span class="n">Person</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">remote</span> <span class="n">Person</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">vm</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="s">&quot;localhost&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
</pre>


<p>Note that the class of any remote object must be declared public.</p>
<p>When working with remote objects, you have access to two new predefined fields :</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>this.remote</strong> : Return the remote reference of the current object</li>
    <li><strong>vm.thisvm</strong> : Return the vm in which the current object has been created</li>
</ul>

<p>When you work with a single virtual machine, the parameter are always passed by value, but when you're working with remote references and several virtual machines, you cannot pass the objects by value, instead, a copy of the object is created and passed to the other virtual machines (JR use RMI and serialization to achieve that). So all the objects you pass to others virtual machines must be declared Serializable to pass through the virtual machines.</p>
<p>There is also others aspects that is interesting to know about working with several virtual machines. First of all, the System.out and System.int streams are inherited from the initial virtual machine. So you can see that the order is not always deterministic depending on the fact on the synchronization of the different prints. The first virtual machine begin the execution in the execution directory but the other virtual machines begins the execution in the user home directory.</p>
<p>Let's finish with a little example. By example, if we take the problem of consumer/producer we solved with Asynchronous Message Passing and we create the producer and consumer in different virtual machines, that will give us something like this : </p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">ProducerConsumer</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<p>All the consumer are created on a specified virtual machine and the producer in an other virtual machine. Here I create the two virtual machines in the same computer, but you can distribute them along several computers. </p>
<p>Here we are !  That post will be the last of the JR set of posts.</p>
