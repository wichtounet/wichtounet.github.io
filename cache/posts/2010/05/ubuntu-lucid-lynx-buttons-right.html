<p>In Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx), the window buttons (minimize, maximize and close) are by default at the left of the window title like in Mac.</p>
<p>This is really disappoiting when you upgrade from an older version of Ubuntu to this one.</p>
<p>But it's really simple to solve that problem.</p>
<p>Open a terminal and type this command :</p>
<pre>gconf-editor</pre>

<p>And then go to : apps &gt; metacity &gt; general. You'll see here a key named button_layout with the default value of "close,minimize,maximize:". To put the buttons like in the other versions, you just have to edit this value to</p>
<pre>:minimize,maximize,close</pre>

<p>And then all your windows  will have the normal button order at the right of the window title bar.</p>
<p>If you want to include the window menu, you can change the value to :</p>
<pre>menu:minimize,maximize,close</pre>

<p>And you will the menu at the left before the title.</p>
