<p>I've made another updates to my file copy benchmark.</p>
<p>First of all, I used my <a title="Utility class to create graphs of benchmark results" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/08/generate-graphs-benchmarks-easily/" target="_blank">little utility class to automatically create the graphs</a>. The graph are a little less clean, but I spare a lot of time not creating them myself.</p>
<p>Then, I've also made some corrections on the code :</p>
<ul>
    <li>I''ve used a buffer size of 8192 instead of 4096</li>
    <li>I've made some corrections using the channels because the old code can forgot to write some portions of the file</li>
    <li>I used allocateDirect() instead of allocate() for the ByteBuffer.</li>
</ul>

<p>And I've added a new method using Java 7 : Path.copyTo(Path path).</p>
<p>So the new results are all based on a Java 7 Virtual Machine.</p>
<p>You'll find all the new informations and result, on the original post : <a title="Java File Copy Benchmark" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/08/file-copy-in-java-benchmark/" target="_self">File Copy in Java - Benchmark</a></p>
<p>I hope this new informations will interest you.</p>
