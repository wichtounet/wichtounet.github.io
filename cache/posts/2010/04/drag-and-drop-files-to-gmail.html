<p>The Gmail team has just added a great new functionality to Gmail.</p>
<p>Until now, to add attachment to your mails, you had to click "Attach a file", find the good file and click it.</p>
<p>Now, you can directly drag the file from your file system to Gmail :</p>

<p>It's a little functionality, but that save a lot of time and that's the kind of feature we (computer scientist) love.</p>
<p>Try it, that's awesome !</p>
