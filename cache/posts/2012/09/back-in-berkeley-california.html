<p>I arrived yesterday to Berkeley, California.</p>
<p>Just like I did my Bachelor thesis in Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), I will do my Master Thesis there too. The thesis will last a bit less than a semester.</p>
<p>During my Master Thesis I will try to use profiling samples from the Linux perf tools in GCC or Clang to optimize processor cache usage (avoid cache and page faults).</p>
<p>I will try to publish some posts about that during the semester if I have time.</p>
