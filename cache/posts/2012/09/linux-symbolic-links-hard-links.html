<p>On Linux, it is possible to create <strong>links to existing file</strong>. These links can be either <strong>symbolic links</strong> or <strong>hard links</strong>. Each of them having advantages and drawbacks. In this small post, we will see the differences between the two kinds of links and how to use them.</p>
<h2>Hard Link</h2>

<p>An hard link refers directly to the physical location of another file (an inode to be precise).</p>
<p>A hard link has some limitations: it cannot refer to a directory and cannot cross file system boundaries. It means that you can only create hard links to the same file system where the hard link is located.</p>
<p>When the source of the link is moved or removed, the hard link still refer to the source.</p>
<p>Symbolic link are created with the <strong>ln</strong> command. For instance, to create a link to source_file: </p>
<pre>ln source_file link</pre>

<h2>Symbolic Link</h2>

<p>A symbolic link refers to a symbolic path indicating the location of the source file. You can see it as a link to a path (itself refering to an inode).</p>
<p>A symbolic link is less limited. It can refer to a directory and can cross file system boundaries.</p>
<p>However, when the source of the link is moved or removed, the symbolic link is not updated.</p>
<p>Symbolic link are created with the <strong>ln</strong> command. For instance, to create a symbolic link to source_file:</p>
<pre>ln -s source_file link</pre>

<h2>Deletion</h2>

<p>The deletion of a link (hard or symbolic) can be achieved with the <strong>rm</strong> or <strong>unlink</strong> commands: </p>
<pre>rm link
unlink link</pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>And that's it!</p>
<p>Symbolic and hard links are very useful tools and are very easy to use. </p>
<p>I hope that this blog post helped you understand a little better the differences between the two types of links and how to use them.</p>
