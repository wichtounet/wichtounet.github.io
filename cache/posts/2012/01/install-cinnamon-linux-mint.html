<p>In the last Linux Mint version (12), the developers have introduced a set of extensions to the Gnome Shell, Mint Gnome Shell Extensions (MGSE).</p>
<p>But, plugins can't do everything the developers want. So they forked Gnome Shell and started building their own shell : Cinnamon.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the appearance of this new shell is similar to MGSE in Linux Mint 12, but with some differences : only one status bar, the left bottom menu was changed, notification bar in the bottom bar, ...</p>
<p>You can try it on your Linux Mint right now :</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cinnamon-session</pre>

<p>Then, you have to logout and select Cinnamon in the Logon screen as the desktop environment. </p>
<p>Personally, I still prefer MGSE, because I like having two bars, but that will perhaps change with some more tests on Cinnamon. And you, what do you think about Cinnamon ? Or about MGSE ? </p>
