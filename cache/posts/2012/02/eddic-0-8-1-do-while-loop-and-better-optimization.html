<p>Only three days after the 0.8 version, I finished the 0.8.1 version.</p>
<p>It's a minor version, so there is no big changes to the language. However, I added support for the <strong>do while loop</strong> in the source code.</p>
<p>Another change is that assignment is now returning a value. That allows you to make some code like this one:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre>


<p>This new version includes also some new changes for the optimization engine. I implemented <strong>constant propagation</strong> and <strong>copy propagation</strong> for offset assignment. For example:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre>


<p>becomes:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre>


<p>And the last change is that the concatenations that are detected to be constant after some optimization are made at compile-time by the optimization engine. This simplify a lot the generated code for source file with a lot of concatenations.</p>
<p>The next version (the 0.9) will introduce floating point operations and parameter passing with registers (probably only in 64 bit). It's also possible that I will try to implement a first version of global optimization.</p>
