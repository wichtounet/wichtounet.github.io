<div class="p-summary">
        <div>
<p>It's been a while since I've <a class="reference external" href="https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2016/09/expression-templates-library-etl-10.html">released the version 1.0 of ETL</a>. There is some work to do before I release the next version, but I wanted to give you a quick update on what has been going on for ETL in the last months. There has been a lot of changes in the library and the next version will be a major update when I'm done with some refactorings and improvements.</p>
<p>Thanks to my thesis supervisor, the project now has a logo:</p>
<img alt="ETL Logo" class="align-center" src="images/logo.png"><p>There are quite a few new features, although probably nothing really major. The
support for square root has been improved with cubic root and inverse root.
Vectors can now be transformed using floor and ceil. Cross product of vector has
been implemented as well. Batched outer product and batched bias averaging (for
machine learning) are now supported. Reductions have also been improved with
absolute sum and mean (asum/asum) support and min_index and max_index. argmax
can now be used to get the max index in each sub dimensions. Matrix can now be
decomposed into their Q/R decomposition rather than only their PALU
decomposition. The matrices can now be sliced by getting only a sub part of the
matrix. The pooling operators  have also been improved with stride and padding
support. Matrices and vectors can also be shuffled. Moreover, a few adapters
are now available for hermitian matrices, symmetric matrices and lower and upper
matrices. So far the support for these adapters is not huge, but they are
guaranteed to validate their constraints.</p>
<p>Several operations have been optimized for speed. All the pooling and upsample
operators are now parallelized and the most used kernel (2x2 pooling) is now
more optimized. 4D convolution kernels (for machine learning) have been greatly
improved. There are now very specialized vectorized kernels for classic kernel
configurations (for instance 3x3 or 5x5) and the selection of implementations is
now smarter than before. The support of padding now much better than before for
small amount of padding. Moreover, for small kernels the full convolution can
now be evaluated using the valid convolution kernels directly with some padding,
for much faster overall performance. Matrix-matrix multiplication with
transposed matrices is now much faster when using BLAS kernels. Indeed, the
transposition is not performed but handled inside the kernels. Moreover, the
performance of the transposition itself is also much faster. Finally, accesses
to 3D and 4D matrices is now much faster than before.</p>
<p>The parallelization feature of ETL has been completely reworked. Before, there
was a thread pool for each algorithm that was parallelized. Now, there is
a global thread engine with one thread pool. Since parallelization is not nested
in ETL, this improves performance slightly by greatly diminishing the number of
threads that are created throughout an application.</p>
<p>Vectorization has also been greatly improved in ETL. Integer operations are now
automatically vectorized on processors that support this. The automatic
vectorizer now is able to use non-temporal stores for very large operations.
A non-temporal store bypasses the cache, thus gaining some time. Since very
large matrices do not fit in cache, this is a net gain. Moreover, the alignment
detection in the automatic vectorizer has also been improved. Support for
Fused-Multiply-Add (FMA) operations has also been integrated in the algorithms
that can make use of it. The matrix-matrix multiplications and vector-matrix
multiplications now have optimized vectorized kernels. They also have versions
for column-major matrices now. The old egblas version of the gemm, based on BLIS
kernels, has been removed since it was only supporting double-precision and was
not faster than the new vectorized algorithm. I plan to reintegrate a version of
the GEMM based on BLIS in the future but with more optimizations and support for
all precisions and integers. The sum and the dot product now also have
specialized vectorized implementations. The min and max operations are now
automatically-vectorized.</p>
<p>The GPU has also been almost completely reworked. Now, operations can be chained
without any copies between GPU and CPU. Several new operations have also been
added with support to GPU. Moreover, to complement operations that are not
available in any of the supported NVIDIA libraries, I've created a simple
library that can be used to add a few more GPU operations. Nevertheless a lot of
operations are still missing and only algorithms are available not expressions
(such as c = a + b * 1.0) that are entirely computed on CPU. I have plans to
improve that further, but probably not before the version 1.2.</p>
<p>There also have been a lot of refactorings in the code of the library. A lot of
expressions now have less overhead and are specialized for performance.
Moreover, temporary expressions are currently being reworked in order to be more
simple and maintainable and easier to optimize in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, there also was quite a few bug fixes. Most of them have been found by
the use of the library in the Deep Learning Library (DLL) project.</p>

        <div>
<p>I've improved a bit my home automation installation. It's been a while since
the last upgrade, but unfortunately I cannot afford as many upgrades as I would
like :P</p>
<p>For a long time I wanted to monitor the power consumption of a few of my
appliances in my apartment. Especially my Linux servers so that I could try to
improve the consumption and reduce my bill on the long run. Unfortunately, there
are very few options for power meter in Switzerland due to the special type of
plug we have. The only option I found is a Zwave power plug. For a while,
I waited to see if I could find other options because Zwave devices are quite
expensive and I would have rather preferred to stay with simpler and cheaper
RF-433 appliances. Since I didn't find anything, I ordered a ZWave USB
controller from  Aeon Labs (the generation 5). I also ordered two Aeon Labs
Swiss Smart Plug with power meter.</p>
<p>Here is an image of the Aeon Labs key:</p>
<img alt="Aeon Labs ZWave USB Key" class="align-center" src="images/zwave_usb.jpg"><p>And of the power meter in usage:</p>
<img alt="ZWave power meter" class="align-center" src="images/power_meter.jpg"><p>Integration of ZWave into Domoticz was extremely easy. I just plugged the USB
key, restarted Domoticz (seems necessary for it to pick the new tty) and added
new hardware "OpenZWave USB" with the correct serial port. From there, there are
two main ways to add new devices. The first is to remove the USB key and use the
synchronization button on both the key and the device close to each other. The
other way is to use the "Include Node" option on Domoticz and then press the
synchronization button on the device to detect the new device. I used the second
option since it seemed simpler and it worked perfectly. I did that for my two
plugs and it worked fine. Directly after this, 5 new devices were added for each
of the plug. One for the voltage, one for the current , two for the  usage (I
don't know why there is two, but they are both reporting the same value) and one
for the switch on/off. I was a bit afraid that only the On/Off part of the smart
plug would work on Domoticz, but I had absolutely no problem.</p>
<p>Here is for instance the power usage of last 24 hours on my television system:</p>
<img alt="Power usage on television system" class="align-center" src="images/domoticz_power_usage.png"><p>For now, I haven't integrated this information on any rule, but I plan to
monitor this information in the coming weeks and try to improve my consumption,
especially for my servers. I also plan to purchase more of these plugs once my
home automation budget can be upgraded.</p>
<p>On another note, I also purchased a Chacon wall remote switch working in RF-433.
Although it is quite cheap, I'm very disappointed by the quality of this switch.
I add to straighten myself the pins that are attached to the battery because
there was no contact. After that, it worked correctly and it is able to work
with the RFLink module.</p>
<p>I have to say that I'm quite satisfied with ZWave devices with this experience.
Even though I still feel it is way too expensive, it is high quality and have
a good finishing. I'll probably purchase more ZWave devices in the future. I'm
especially interested in The Aeotec 6 in 1 sensor for temperature humidity,
motion, light, UV and vibration. This would allow me to have much information in
each room with only one sensor in place of several sensors in each room like
I currently have.</p>
<p>I still have a few Milight Bulbs and LEDS to install with a secondary Milight
bridge that I will install in the coming week, but I probably won't do a post
about this.</p>

<div class="p-summary">
        <div>
<p>After my previous post about my publication on CPU performance optimization,
I wanted to talk a bit about two publications on Handwritten Keyword Spotting,
in which we extract features with Convolutional RBM RBM</p>
<p>We published two different papers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306081095_Keyword_Spotting_with_Convolutional_Deep_Belief_Networks_and_Dynamic_Time_Warping">Keyword Spotting With Convolutional Deep Belief Networks and Dynamic Time Warping</a>, in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN-2016), Barcelona, Spain</li>
<li>Mixed Handwritten and printed digit recognition in Sudoku With Convolutional Deep Belief Network (Link will come), in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR-2016), Cancun, Mexico</li>
</ul>
<p>The second paper is mostly a large extension of the first one, so I'll focus on
the complete version.</p>
<p>On a side note, I also co-authored a third paper:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312486359_Inkball_Models_as_Features_for_Handwriting_Recognition">Inkball Models as Features for Handwriting Recognition</a>, in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Frontiers of Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR-2016), Shenzen, China</li>
</ul>
<p>We mostly used our existing system to generate features for a comparison between
different set of features for handwritten keyword spotting. It was my first time
in China and I enjoyed the stay a lot. I also had the chance to meet my
girlfriend in Shenzen, all the more reason to mention this publication :)</p>
<p>Back on the main subject. The idea behind these publications is to
a Convolutional Deep Belief Network (CDBN) to extract features from the images
and then pass these features to either a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm or
an Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The following image describe the overall system:</p>
<img alt="Keyword Spotting System" class="align-center" src="images/kws_system.png"><p>The features are extracted from preprocessed normalized binary images. Using
a sliding window, moving from left to right, one pixel at a time, the features
are extracted on each window. The feature extractor is a Convolutional Deep
Belief Network, trained fully unsupervised. The features are then normalized so
that each feature group sum to one and then each has zero-mean and
unit-variance. The network used for feature extraction is depicted in the
following image:</p>
<img alt="Convolutional Deep Belief Network features" class="align-center" src="images/kws_network.png"><p>Two Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) are used, each followed
by a max pooling layer.</p>
<p>Once the features are extracted, they can be passed to the classifier for
keyword spotting scoring. We tested our features with two different approaches
for word scoring. The first one is a template matching strategy, Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW), is a very simple measure of distance between two sequences of
different length. The two sequences are warped non-linearly to minimize the
distance between each pair of features. A template from the training set is
compared to the word image being evaluated. This works pretty well for simple
data sets but fails when the writing styles of the test set are not known in the
training set. The second classifier is more powerful and trained, a Hidden
Markov Model (HMM). Character models are trained using the entire training set.
From these character models, a keyword model as well as an unconstrained model
(the filler model) are constructed. The probability of these two models is
computed using Viterbi and the final score is computed using log-odds scoring of
these two models using the filler model as a form of normalization.</p>
<p>This technique was evaluated on three datasets (George Washington (GW), Parzival
(PAR) and IAM offline database (IAM)). Our features were compared with three
reference feature sets, one heuristic and two local feature sets.</p>
<p>The results for DTW:</p>
<img alt="Keyword Spotting Results with Dynamic Time Warping" class="align-center" src="images/kws_results_dtw.png"><p>Overall, our features exhibit better performance than the other reference.
Except for the Mean Average Precision on the PAR data set. The very low
performance on PAR with DTW is explained by the fact mentioned earlier that it
has poor generalization to unknown writing styles.</p>
<p>The results for HMM:</p>
<img alt="Keyword Spotting Results with Hidden Markov Model" class="align-center" src="images/kws_results_hmm.png"><p>With HMM, our features are always better than the other feature sets. However,
the margin of improvement is smaller than when using DTW.</p>
<p>Overall, the proposed system proved quite powerful and was able to outperform
the three tested feature sets on three datasets for keyword spotting.</p>
<p>You can find the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/word_spotting">C++ implementation on Github</a>.</p>
<p>As for my thesis, I have finished the writings about a month ago and it is now
in the hands on my supervisor.</p>
<p>If you want to have a look, the
<a class="reference external" href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/stories/publications.html">list of my publications</a>
is available on this website.</p>
<p>If you want more details on this project, don't hesitate to ask here or on
Github, or read the papers :)</p>
<p>I hope the next post about my publications will be about the finalization of my
thesis :)</p>

<p>In a previous post, I compared the <a class="reference external" href="https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/03/disappointing-zapcc-performance-on-deep-learning-library-dll.html">compilation time on my Deep Learning Library (DLL) project with different compilers</a>. I realized that the compilation times were quickly going unreasonable for this library, especially for compiling the unit cases which clearly hurts the development of the library. Indeed, you want to be able to run the unit tests reasonably quickly after you integrated new changes.</p>
<div class="section" id="reduce-the-compilation-time">
<h2>Reduce the compilation time</h2>
<p>The first thing I did was to split the compilation in three executables: one for
the unit tests, one for the various performance tests and one for the various other
miscellaneous tests. With this, it is much faster to compile only the unit test
cases.</p>
<p>But this can be improved significantly more. In DLL a network is a variadic
template containing the list of layers, in order. In DLL, there are two main
different ways of declaring a neural networks. In the first version, the fast
version, the layers directly know their sizes:</p>

<p>In my opinion, this is the best way to use DLL. This is the fastest and the
clearest. Moreover, the dimensions of the network can be validated at compile
time, which is always better than at runtime. However, the dimensions of the
network cannot be changed at runtime.  For this, there is a different version,
the dynamic version:</p>

<p>This is a bit more verbose, but the configuration can be changed at runtime with
this system. Moreover, this is also faster to compile. On the other hand, there
is some performance slowdown.</p>
<p>There is also a third version that is a hybrid of the first version:</p>

<p>Only one line was changed compared to the first version, <code>dbn_desc</code>
becomes <code>dyn_dbn_desc</code>. What this changes is that all the layers are
automatically transformed into their dynamic versions and all the parameters are
propagated at runtime. This is a form a type erasing since the sizes will not be
propagated at compilation time. But this is simple since the types are simply
transformed from one type to another directly. Behind the scene, it's the
dynamic version using the front-end of the fast version. This is almost as fast
to compile as the dynamic version, but the code is much better. It executes the
same as the dynamic version.</p>
<p>If we compare the compilation time of the three versions when compiling a single
network and 5 different networks with different architectures, we get the
following results (with clang):</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">

<p>Even with one single network, the compilation time is reduced by 44%. When five
different networks are compilation, time is reduced by 85%. This can be
explained easily. Indeed, for the hybrid and dynamic versions, the layers will
have the same type and therefore a lot of template instantiations will only be
done once instead of five times. This makes a lot of difference since almost
everything is template inside the library.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this also has an impact on the runtime of the network:</p>

<td>203</td>
<td>123</td>

<tr>

<td>204</td>
<td>122</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>On average, for dense models, the slowdown is between 4% and 8%. For
convolutional models, it is between 10% and 25%. I will definitely work on
trying to make the dynamic and especially the hybrid version faster in the
future, most on the work should be on the matrix library (ETL) that is used.</p>
<p>Since for test cases, a 20% increase in runtime is not really a problem, tests
being fast already, I decided to add an option to DLL so that everything can be
compiled by default in hybrid model. By using a compilation flag, all the
<code>dbn_desc</code> are becoming <code>dyn_dbn_desc</code> and therefore each used
network is becoming a hybrid network. Without a single change in the code, the
compilation time of the entire library can be significantly improved, as seen in
the next section.  This can also be used in user code to improve compilation
time during debugging and experiments and can be turned off for the final
training.</p>
<p>On my Continuous Integration system, I will build the system in both
configurations. This is not really an issue, since my personal machine at home
is more powerful than what I have available here.</p>

<p>On a first experiment, I measured the difference before and after this change on
the three executables of the library, with gcc:</p>

<p>It is clear that the speedups are very significant! The compilation is between
25% and 40% faster with the new option. Overall, this is a speedup of 36%!
I also noticed that the compilation takes significantly less memory than before.
Therefore, I decided to rerun the compiler benchmark on the library. In the
previous experiment, zapcc was taking so much memory that it was impossible to
use more than one thread. Let's see how it is faring now. The time to compile
the full unit tests is computed for each compiler. Let's start in debug mode:</p>

<p>This time, zapcc is able to scale to four threads without problems. Moreover, it
is always the fastest compiler, by a significant margin, in this configuration.
It is followed by clang and then by gcc for which both versions are about the
same speed.</p>

<p>The difference in compilation time is very large, it's twice slower to compile
with all optimizations enabled. It also takes significantly more memory. Indeed,
zapcc was not able to compile with 4 threads. Nevertheless, even the results
with three threads are better than the other compilers using four threads. zapcc
is clearly the winner again on this test, followed by gcc4-9 which is faster
than gcc-5.3 which is itself faster than clang. It seems that while clang is
better at frontend than gcc, it is slower for optimizations. Note that this may
also be an indication that clang performs more optimizations than gcc and may
not be slower.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By using some form of type erasing to simplify the templates types at compile
time, I was able to reduce the overall compilation time of my Deep Learning
Library (DLL) by 36%. Moreover, this can be done by switching a simple
compilation flag. This also very significantly reduce the memory used during the
compilation, allowing zapcc to to compile with up to three threads, compared
with only one before. This makes zapcc the fastest compiler again on this
benchmark. Overall, this will make debugging much easier on this library and
will save me a lot of time.</p>
<p>In the future, I plan to try to improve compilation time even more. I have a few
ideas, especially in ETL that should significantly improve the compilation time
but that will require a lot of time to implement, so that will likely have to
wait a while. In the coming days, I plan to work on the performance of DLL,
especially for stochastic gradient descent.</p>
