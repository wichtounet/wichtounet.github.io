A bit more than two months ago, I started a new project: thor-os</p><p>This project is a simple 64bit operating system, written in C++. After having written a compiler, I decided it could be fun to try with an operating system. And it is fun indeed :) It is a really exciting project and there are plenty of things to do in every directions.</p><p>I've also written the bootloader myself, but it is a very simple one. It just reads the kernel from the floppy. loads it in memory and then jumps to it and nothing else.</p><h4>Features</h4><p>Right now, the project is fairly modest. Here are the features of the kernel:</p><ul> <li>Serial Text Console</li> <li>Keyboard driver</li> <li>Timer driver (PIT)</li> <li>Dynamic Memory Allocation</li> <li>ATA driver</li> <li>FAT32 driver (Work In progress)</li> <li>Draft of an ACPI support (only for shutdown)</li></ul><p>All the commands are accessible with a simple shell integrated directly in the kernel.</p><h4>Testing</h4><p>All the testing is made in Bochs and Qemu. I don't have any other computer available to test in real right now but that is something I really want to do. But for now, my bootloader only supports floppy, so it will need to be improved to load the kernel from a disk, since it is not likely that I will have a floppy disk to test :D</p><p>Here is a screenshot of the OS in action:</p><p><a href=wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screenshot-from-2013-12-17-085810-e1387267703665.png><img class="size-medium wp-image-2628" alt="Thor OS Screenshot" src=wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screenshot-from-2013-12-17-085810-e1387267703665-300x204.png width=300 height=204></a></p><h4>Future</h4><p>The next thing that I will improve is the FAT32 driver to have a complete implementation including creating and writing to files.</p><p>After that, I still don't know whether I will try to implement a simple Framebuffer or start implement user space.</p><p>As for all my projects, you can find the complete source code on Github: https://github.com/wichtounet/thor-os</p><p>Don't hesitate to comment if you have any question or suggestion for this project ;) I will try to write some posts about it on the future, again if you have idea of subject for these posts, don't hesitate. The first will probably be about the boot process.</p></div> </div> <p> <a href=posts/2013/12/new-hobby-project-thor-os-64bit-operating-system-c.html#disqus_thread data-disqus-identifier=cache/posts/2013/12/new-hobby-project-thor-os-64bit-operating-system-c.html>Comments</a> </p></article> <article class="postbox h-entry post-text"> <h1 class=p-name><a href=posts/2013/12/gentoo-tips-avoid-gnome-3-8-emerged-automatically.html class=u-url>Gentoo Tips: Avoid Gnome 3.8 from being emerged automatically</a> <br><small>   Posted: <time class="published dt-published" datetime=2013-12-07T06:24:17+01:00>2013-12-07 06:24</time> </small></h1> <hr> <div class=p-summary> <div><p>Since Gnome 3.8 has been out in the portage tree, a lot of problems arise when you try to emerge something. If it was only when you update the system, it would be OK, but this arises every time you try to install something.</p><p>For instance, if I try to update vim on my system, it tries to update empathy to version 3.8 and then pulls some other dependencies causing blocks and other USE problems. I personally don't think empathy should be emerged when emerging vim. Fortunately, you can disable this behavior by using emerge in this way:</p><pre>emerge --ignore-built-slot-operator-deps=y ...</pre><p>With that, when you emerge vim, it doesn't emerge Gnome 3.8. It is very useful if you want to stay with Gnome 3.6 for the moment.</p><p>I already used this tip several times.

First, I've added a graph of the expenses/earnings/balances of each month for a given year in the form of a bar plot. You can see an example in practice here:</p><p><a href=wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screenshot-from-2013-10-25-215839.png><img class="size-medium wp-image-2617" alt="budgetwarrior monthly report" src=wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screenshot-from-2013-10-25-215839-300x266.png width=300 height=266></a></p><p>Nothing fancy, but it gives a good overview of the current state of your budget.</p><p>I've added a new module, called fortune, that lets you enter your total fortune and then computes the difference between the entered fortune statuses. For now, it doesn't do anything else with this data. But in the future, I want to correlate this data with the balances to check the difference between the filled expenses and earnings and the fortune evolution.</p><p>I've also added a more convenient way of creating expenses and earnings. Just type "budget expense add" and you'll be able to fill all the fields one by one. Of course, the command line commands are still available.</p><p>The last new feature I've added is an aggregate report (budget overview aggregate). This view simply groups all the expenses with the same name of a year together. If you always use the same expense title for your groceries, you'll see the total you spent in groceries for a year. You can also name your expenses with the format "Category/Expenses" and all the expenses with the same category will be grouped together in the aggregate view. That allows you to still have enough details in the monthly overview but to logically groups your expenses together in the aggregate view.</p><p>The other changes are minor. I've improved the monthly overview to sort the expenses and earnings by date. To facilitate the storage of the files in a service like Dropbox, the data and configuration files are now only written if they have been modified. The mean in the current overview has been changed to reflect only the months up to the current month and not the future (which was just ruining the means).</p><p>If you are interested by the tool, you can download it on Github: <a title="budgetwarrior repository" href=https://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior>budgetwarrior</a></p><p>I hope this tool will be useful to some people. If you've any question, just let a comment on this post or contact me directly by email. I'll be glad to help.</p></div> </div> <p> <a href=posts/2013/10/budgetwarrior-0-2-visual-reports-fortune-status-expenses-aggregates.html#disqus_thread data-disqus-identifier=cache/posts/2013/10/budgetwarrior-0-2-visual-reports-fortune-status-expenses-aggregates.html>Comments</a> </p></article> <article class="postbox h-entry post-text"> <h1 class=p-name><a href=posts/2013/08/home-server-adventure-step-2.html class=u-url>Home Server Adventure - Step 2</a> <br><small>   Posted: <time class="published dt-published" datetime=2013-08-27T09:16:21+02:00>2013-08-27 09:16</time> </small></h1> <hr> <div class=p-summary> <div><p>If you remember, I talked about <a title="Home Server Adventure – Step 1" href=http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2013/07/home-server-adventure-step-1/>my home server project</a> in a previous post. I had installed an old Dell Poweredge server, a 3com gigabit switch and a monitoring console. The problem with this configuration was that it was too noisy as the rack is installed in my apartment.</p><p>The first thing I did was to <a title="ZyXEL GS1910-24 Managed Gigabit Switch Review" href=http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2013/07/zyxel-gs1910-managed-gigabit-switch-review/>replace my old 3Com switch with a Zyxel managed fanless switch</a>. Being fanless, this switch is completely silent which makes a good difference :)</p><p>After that, I have replaced the Dell server with <a title="Norco RPC 230 Case Review" href=http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2013/08/norco-rpc-230-case-review/>a custom installation in a Norco-RPC 230 case</a>. The basic case comes with two 80mm fans in the front. These two fans are very powerful, but they are quite noisy. I replaced them with two Enermax T.B. Silence 80mm fans. They are almost silent, it is really great. It is probably not enough airflow for a large configuration, but in my case, I think that this will be largely enough.</p><p>I've already installed several services on my server:</p><ul> <li>Tiny Tiny RSS: a web-based news feed reader and aggregator. I use it to replace Feedly which I was getting less and less fond to.</li> <li>Sabnzbd: I already had this NZB download on my desktop, but now as it is on the server, it can download even when I'm not at home.</li> <li>Zabbix: a monitoring application that manages all my appliances and server (the new server, the NAS, the switch and the router). It is my first attempt with Zabbix. It is a bit cryptic to conigure, but the features are very numerous.</li> <li>Teamspeak and Mumble: They already were installed on the previous server.</li></ul><p>I plan to install new services on the future, but I have no plans for now.</p><p>Here is a picture of the rack in its current state:</p><p><a href=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-23-15.31.45.jpg><img class="size-medium wp-image-2610" alt="19 Rack" src=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-23-15.31.45-168x300.jpg width=168 height=300></a></p><p>I have also installed my router and the NAS on a layer in the rack.</p><p>You can't see it, but I have also added to rackable PDU on the back to have to organize a bit the cables. Even if it still not perfect, it is already better than before.</p><p>For now, I think that my system in in good shape. When I will have some more budget, I will replace QNAP NAS with a custom server, probably again with a Norco case.</p></div> </div> <p> <a href=posts/2013/08/home-server-adventure-step-2.html#disqus_thread data-disqus-identifier=cache/posts/2013/08/home-server-adventure-step-2.html>Comments</a> </p></article> <article class="postbox h-entry post-text"> <h1 class=p-name><a href=posts/2013/08/budgetwarrior-command-line-personal-budgeting.html class=u-url>budgetwarrior 0.1.0 - command-line personal budgeting tool</a> <br><small>   Posted: <time class="published dt-published" datetime=2013-08-26T08:41:03+02:00>2013-08-26 08:41</time> </small></h1> <hr> <div class=p-summary> <div><p>Being bored by using Google spreadsheets for my personal budgeting, I decided to write an application to do that. Being a huge fan of taskwarrior, I decided to write a kind of similar application for my personal budget, budgetwarrior was born. I use it since two months and I thought that it could be useful for other persons. The application is developed in C++. More information is available on Github: <a title=https://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior href=https://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior>https://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior</a>.</p><p>budgetwarrior 0.1.0 is a command-line only tool. It works on this principle: you create a set of accounts with a certain limit and then you declare your expenses in each of these accounts. You can also manage earnings that are not each month in each account. You can also keeps track of your debts via this application. It also supports automatic creation of recurring expenses, for instance when you pay the rent (for now, only monthly expenses are supported).</p><p>Once you've put all your data in the application, it provides you report on the state of your budget by month or by year. For instance, here is my current monthly report:</p><p><a href=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screenshot-from-2013-08-23-145358.png><img class="size-medium wp-image-2601" title="Monthly Report" alt="Monthly Report" src=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screenshot-from-2013-08-23-145358-300x95.png width=300 height=95></a></p><p>You can see directly which accounts are in a good shape and which are not.</p><p>Here is the current yearly report:</p><p><a href=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screenshot-from-2013-08-23-145911.png><img class="size-medium wp-image-2602" alt="Yearly report" src=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screenshot-from-2013-08-23-145911-300x252.png width=300 height=252></a></p><p>In this view, you can see directly how your accounts evolve during the year and where are your biggest expenses and earnings.</p><p>As everything is displayed horizontally, the more accounts you have the larger the view become. With the 7 accounts I have, it takes about 1600 pixels of width to display it. I will try to improve that in the future if some people are interested in making it work on smaller screens.</p><h4>Installation</h4><p>You can install budgetwarrior directly from the sources:</p><pre>git clone -b master git://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior.git
cd budgetwarrior
cmake .
make
sudo make install</pre><p>After that, you can use budgetwarrior by using the command <em>budget</em>.</p><p>The usage is fairly simple, you can use <em>budget help</em> to have the list of the commands that you have to use to create expenses and earnings and display overviews.</p><h4>The project</h4><p>If you have any question on the project, don't hesitate to contact me or to post a comment to this post. If there are people interested, I can write a more complete help.</p><p>If you have a suggestion or you found a bug, please post an issue on the github project: <a title=https://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior href=https://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior>https://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior</a>.</p></div> </div> <p> <a href=posts/2013/08/budgetwarrior-command-line-personal-budgeting.html#disqus_thread data-disqus-identifier=cache/posts/2013/08/budgetwarrior-command-line-personal-budgeting.html>Comments</a> </p></article> <article class="postbox h-entry post-text"> <h1 class=p-name><a href=posts/2013/08/norco-rpc-230-case-review.html class=u-url>Norco RPC 230 Case Review</a> <br><small>   Posted: <time class="published dt-published" datetime=2013-08-21T08:38:03+02:00>2013-08-21 08:38</time> </small></h1> <hr> <div class=p-summary> <div><p>As my previous Dell 1U server was <a title="Home Server Adventure – Step 1" href=http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2013/07/home-server-adventure-step-1/>too noisy for my home server installation</a>. I invested in a case, a Norco RPC 230 model. This case is a 2U standard case for 19" rack. It supports micro-ATX motherboard and ATX power supply. These components are easy too find, so that makes it a very interesting case for a home server installation.</p><p>I ordered the case at <a title="Ri-Vier Automatisering" href=https://ri-vier.eu/>Ri-Vier Automatisering</a>, which is the Norco european distributor. I directly ordered it with the RL-26 rails for the rack and the ATX power supply that is provided by Ri-Vier. For the case, I also bought a micro-ATX Gigabyte G41M-Combo motherboard. I already had 4GB of DDR2 RAM and a Core 2 Duo processor from a previous configuration. I also took my old 120GB Samung SSD for this server. This would be largely sufficient for what I plan to run on this server.</p><p>The case has four 3.5" drive bays and one 5.25" drive bay. The air flow is provided with two 80mm fans on the front panel.</p><h4>Package</h4><p>I received the package very quickly from Ri-Vier. The case is packaged in double box and everything in the package is well ordered. The power supply was already in the box itself. Here is a picture of the content of the package:</p><p><a href=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-09.45.14.jpg><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2596" alt="2013-08-20 09.45.14" src=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-09.45.14-300x168.jpg width=300 height=168></a></p><p>It contains only the case and the necessary screws. The rails are not on this picture, since I already had installed them in my rack. As you see, there are no manual, which may be a bit frustrating. Once you remove the top panel (4 screws to remove), you can see the inside of the case:</p><p><a href=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-09.54.09.jpg><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2595" alt="2013-08-20 09.54.09" src=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-09.54.09-300x168.jpg width=300 height=168></a></p><p>On the top are the four bays for the drives. They are removable. As you can see on the picture, the power supply has plenty of cables. I would have expected a power supply with less cables to come with this case as there is not much room.</p><p>Here is a view of the front panel:</p><p><a href=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.11.22.jpg><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2593" alt="2013-08-20 11.11.22" src=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.11.22-300x168.jpg width=300 height=168></a></p><p>There are two USB ports on the front, the Power and Reset buttons as well as LEDS.</p><h4>Installation</h4><p>Even without any manual, the installation is fairly easy. The top panel can be removed by unscrewing 4 four screws on the side. I strongly recommend to remove the 4 drive bays before installing the other components to make some room. Once it is done, the motherboard can be screwed in place. The power supply is attached by four screws on the back panel.</p><p>I installed a SSD 2.5" in the leftmost disk bay. I had some issues with this installation as the bays do not have any screws on the side, only on the bottom. They are really not made for anything else than 3.5" drives.</p><p>Here is a picture of my installation once finished:</p><p><a href=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.11.39.jpg><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2592" alt="2013-08-20 11.11.39" src=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.11.39-300x168.jpg width=300 height=168></a></p><p>I managed to make it looks nice with the cables, but only because I have not installed any CD-Rom, so I did put a lot of cables in its place.</p><p>Once it is done, I have installed it in my rack. It is not straightforward without a manual, but I was able to screw it to the rails. I did put two screws on each side:</p><p><a href=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.31.08.jpg><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2591" alt="2013-08-20 11.31.08" src=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.31.08-300x168.jpg width=300 height=168></a></p><p>Once in place, it looks quite good:</p><p><a href=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.31.51.jpg><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2590" alt="2013-08-20 11.31.51" src=wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.31.51-300x168.jpg width=300 height=168></a></p><p>However, I don't know if I have done something wrong, but the rails are not sliding smoothly, they are blocking at two places and the last part is quite hard to push. Anyway, as I won't be moving it a lot, I think it is ok. You also have to remember that even if it is a short depth case, the RL-26 rails are not short at all, they are not made for short depth racks.</p><p>Once it is launched, the server is quite busy due to the two 80mm fans. However, the airflow is quite strong, which is what most customers want. It is still more silent than my Dell server, but not enough for a home experience. I will try to replace them with more silent fans in the future.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul> <li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Enough bays for a simple server</span></li> <li>Support standard formats</li> <li>Enough air flow</li> <li>Very short depth</li> <li>Seems of heavy duty construction</li> <li>Looks nice</li> <li>Not too expensive</li> <li>Should fit in most racks</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul> <li><span style="line-height: 13px;">No manuals at all</span></li> <li>Disk bays not very convenient</li> <li>The provided power supply is not very adapted to the case.</li> <li>The provided rails seems to not slide smoothly</li></ul><p>To conclude, I would say that this case is very fit to a custom installation as all the components are standards. I would recommend it for a similar usage than mine.</p></div> </div> <p> <a href=posts/2013/08/norco-rpc-230-case-review.html#disqus_thread data-disqus-identifier=cache/posts/2013/08/norco-rpc-230-case-review.html>Comments</a> </p></article> <div> <ul class=pager> <li class=previous> <a href=index.html rel=prev>← Newer posts</a> </li> <li class=next> <a href=index-23.html rel=next>Older posts →</a> </li> </ul> </div> <script>var disqus_shortname="blogwichtounet";(function(){var a=document.createElement("script");a.async=true;a.src="//"+disqus_shortname+".disqus.com/count.js";(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0]).appendChild(a)}());</script> </div> </div> </div></div><footer> Contents © 2014 <a href=mailto:baptistewicht@gmail.com>Baptiste Wicht</a> - Powered by <a href=http://getnikola.com rel=nofollow>Nikola</a><a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/><img alt="Creative Commons License" style=padding-left:5px;border-width:0 src=assets/img/cc.png></a> <ul class=footer_inline_ul> </ul></footer> <script src=assets/js/all-nocdn.js type=text/javascript></script> <script type=text/javascript>
