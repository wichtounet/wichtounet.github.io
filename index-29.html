        <hr>
<div class="p-summary">
        <div>
<p>Update: For a comparison against more modern compiler versions, you can read: <a class="reference external" href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2016/12/zapcc-cpp-compilation-speed-against-gcc-54-and-clang-39.html">zapcc C++ compilation speed against gcc 5.4 and clang 3.9</a></p>
<p>I just joined the private beta program of zapcc. Zapcc is a c++ compiler, based
on Clang which aims at being much faster than other C++ compilers. How they are
doing this is using a caching server that saves some of the compiler structures,
which should speed up compilation a lot. The private beta is free, but once the
compiler is ready, it will be a commercial compiler.</p>
<p>Every C++ developer knows that compilation time can quickly be an issue when
programs are getting very big and especially when working with template-heavy
code.</p>
<p>To benchmark this new compiler, I use my Expression Template Library
(<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl/">ETL</a>). This is a purely header-only
library with lots of templates. There are lots of test cases which is what I'm
going to compile. I'm going to compare against Clang-3.7 and gcc-4.9.3.</p>
<p>I have configured zapcc to let is use 2Go RAM per caching server, which is the
maximum allowed. Moreover, I killed the servers before each tests.</p>
<div class="section" id="debug-build">
<h2>Debug build</h2>
<p>Let's start with a debug build. In that configuration, there is no optimization
going on and several of the features of the library (GPU, BLAS, ...) are
disabled. This is the fastest way to compile ETL. I gathered this result on
a 4 core, 8 threads, Intel processor, with an SSD.</p>
<p>The following table presents the results with different number of threads and
the difference of zapcc compared to the other compilers:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The result is pretty clear! zapcc is around <strong>three times faster than Clang</strong> and around
<strong>two times faster than GCC</strong>. This is pretty impressive!</p>
<p>For those that think than Clang is always faster than GCC, keep in mind that
this is not the case for template-heavy code such as this library. In all my
tests, Clang has always been slower and much memory hungrier than GCC on
template-heavy C++ code. And sometimes the difference is very significant.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we can also see that going past the physical cores is not really
interesting on this computer. On some computer, the speedups are interesting,
but not on this one. Always benchmark!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="release-build">
<h2>Release build</h2>
<p>We have seen the results on a debug build, let's now compare on something a bit
more timely, a release build with all options of ETL enabled (GPU, BLAS, ...),
which should make it significantly longer to compile.</p>

</table>
<p>This time, we can see that the difference is much lower. Zapcc is <strong>between 1.2
and 1.4 times faster than Clang</strong> and <strong>between 1.1 and 1.3 times faster than
GCC</strong>. This shows that most of the speedups from zapcc are in the front end of
the compiler. This is not a lot but still significant over long builds,
especially if you have few threads where the absolute difference would be
higher.</p>
<p>We can also observe that Clang is now almost on par with GCC which shows that
optimization is faster in Clang while front and backend is faster in gcc.</p>
<p>You also have to keep in mind that zapcc memory usage is higher than Clang
because of all the caching. Moreover, the server are still up in between
compilations, so this memory usage stays between builds, which may not be what
you want.</p>
<p>As for runtime, I have not seem any significant difference in performance
between the clang version and the zapcc. According to the official benchmarks
and documentation, there should not be any difference in that between zapcc and
the version of clang on which zapcc is based.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="incremental-build">
<h2>Incremental build</h2>
<p>Normally, zapcc should shine at incremental building, but I was unable to show
any speedup when changing a single without killing the zapcc servers. Maybe
I did something wrong in my usage of zapcc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, we can see that zapcc is always faster than both GCC and Clang,
on my template-heavy library. Moreover, on debug builds, it is much faster than
any of the two compilers, being more than 2 times faster than GCC and more than
3 times faster than clang. This is really great. Moreover, I have not see any
issue with the tool so far, it can seamlessly replace Clang without problem.</p>
<p>It's a bit weird that you cannot allocate more than 2Go to the zapcc servers.</p>
<p>For a program, that's really impressive. I hope that they are continuing the
good work and especially that this motivates other compilers to improve the
speed of compilation (especially of templates).</p>

<p>You may remember <a class="reference external" href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2016/06/reduce-compilation-time-by-another-16-with-catch.html">my quest for faster compilation times</a>. I had made several changes to the Catch test framework macros in order to save some compilation at the expense of my test code looking a bit less nice:</p>
<pre class="code cpp"><a name="rest_code_043ab63819d84c38b82f2acf6e1b2354-1"></a><span class="n">REQUIRE</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">//Before</span>
<a name="rest_code_043ab63819d84c38b82f2acf6e1b2354-2"></a><span class="n">REQUIRE_EQUALS</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">//After</span>
</pre>
<p>The first line is a little bit better, but using several optimizations, I was
able to dramatically change the compilation time of the test cases of ETL. In
the end, I don't think that the difference between the two lines justifies the
high overhead in compilation times.</p>
<div class="section" id="doctest">
<h2>doctest</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/onqtam/doctest">doctest</a> is a framework quite similar to
Catch but that claims to be much lighter. I tested doctest 1.0 early on, but at
this point it was actually slower than Catch and especially slower than my
versions of the macro.</p>
<p>Today, doctest 1.1 was released with promises of being even lighter than before
and providing several new ways of speeding up compilation. If you want the
results directly, you can take a look at the next section.</p>
<p>First of all, this new version improved the basic macros to make expression
decomposition faster. When you use the standard REQUIRE macro, the expression is
composed by using several template techniques and operator overloading. This is
really slow to compile. By removing the need for this decomposition, the fast
Catch macros are much faster to compile.</p>
<p>Moreover, doctest 1.1 also introduces CHECK_EQ that does not any expression
decomposition. This is close to what I did in my macros expect that it is
directly integrated into the framework and preserves all its features. It is
also possible to bypass the expression checking code by using FAST_CHECK_EQ
macro. In that case, the exceptions are not captured. Finally, a new
configuration option is introduced (DOCTEST_CONFIG_SUPER_FAST_ASSERTS) that
removes some features related to automatic debugger breaks. Since I don't use
the debugger features and I don't need to capture exception everywhere (it's
sufficient for me that the test fails completely if an exception is thrown), I'm
more than eager to use these new features.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="results">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>For evaluation, I have compiled the complete test suite of ETL, with 1 thread,
using gcc 4.9.3 with various different options, starting from Catch to doctest
1.1 with all compilation time features. Here are the results, in seconds:</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see, doctest 1.1 is much faster to compile than doctest 1.0! This is
really great news. Moreover, it is already 16% faster than Catch. When all the
features are used, doctest is 12% faster than my stripped down versions of Catch
macros (and 43% faster than Catch standard macros). This is really cool! It
means that I don't have to do any change in the code (no need to strip macros
myself) and I can gain a lot of compilation time compared to the bare Catch
framework.</p>
<p>I really think the author of doctest did a great job with the new version.
Although this was not of as much interest for me, there are also a lot of
other changes in the new version. You can consult the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> if you want more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, doctest 1.1 is much faster to compile than doctest 1.0. Moreover, it
offers very fast macros for test assertions that are much faster to compile
than Catch versions and even faster than the versions I created myself to reduce
compilation time. I really thing this is a great advance for doctest. When
compiling with all the optimizations, doctest 1.1 saves me 50 seconds in
compilation time compared to the fast version of Catch macro and more than
5 minutes compared to the standard version of Catch macros.</p>
<p>I'll probably start using doctest on my development machine. For now, I'll keep
Catch as well since I need it to generate the unit test reports in XML format
for Sonarqube. Once this feature appears in doctest, I'll probably drop Catch
from ETL and DLL</p>
<p>If you need blazing fast compilation times for your unit tests, doctest 1.1 is
probably the way to go.</p>

        <br><small>  
             Posted: <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2016-09-16T13:25:44+02:00">2016-09-16 13:25</time></small>
</h1>
        <hr>
<div class="p-summary">
        <div>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.bullseye.com/">Bullseye</a> is a commercial Code Coverage analyzer.
It is fully-featured with an export to HTML, to XML and even a specific GUI to
see the application.It costs about 800$, with a renewal fee of about 200$ per
year.</p>
<p>I'm currently using gcov and passing the results to Sonar. This works well, but
there are several problems. First, I need to use gcovr to generate the XML file,
that means two tools. Then, gcov has no way to merge coverage reports. In my
tests of ETL, I have seven different profiles being tested and I need the
overall coverage report. lcov has a merge feature but it is slow as hell (it
takes longer to merge the coverage files than to compile and run the complete
test suite seven times...). For now, I'm using a C++ program that I wrote to
combine the XML files or a Python script that does that, but neither are perfect
and it needs maintenance. Finally, it's impossible to exclude some code from the
coverage report (there is code that isn't meant to be executed (exceptional
code)). For now, I'm using yet another C++ program  that I wrote to do this from
comments in code.</p>
<p>Bullseye does have all these feature, so I got an evaluation license online and
tried this tool and wrote a short review of it.</p>
<div class="section" id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The usage is pretty simple. You put the coverage executables in your PATH
variable and activate coverage globally. Then, we you compile, the compiler
calls will be intercepted and a coverage file will be generated. When the
compilation is done, run the program and the coverage measurements will be
filled.</p>
<p>The coverage results can then be exported to HTML (or XML) or visualized using
the CoverageBrowser tool:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Screenshot of Bullseye main coverage view" src="images/bullseye_view.png"><p class="caption">The main view of the Bullseye tool code coverage results</p>
</div>
<p>It's a pretty good view of the coverage result. You have a breakdown by folders,
by file, by function and finally by condition. You can view directly the source
code:</p>

<p>If you want to exclude some code from your coverage reports, you can use
a pragma:</p>

</pre>
<p>So that the condition won't be set as uncovered.</p>
<p>As for the coverage, it's pretty straightforward. For example:</p>
<pre class="code bash"><a name="rest_code_a21de607a1904e8dacf43cb2da260432-1"></a>covmerge -c -ffinal.cov sse.cov avx.cov
</pre>
<p>and it's really fast. Unfortunately, the merging is only done at the function
level, not at the statement or at the condition level. This is a bit
disappointing, especially from a commercial tool. Nevertheless, it works well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude, Bullseye seems to be a pretty good tool. It has more features than
standard gcov coverage and all features are well integrated together. I have
only covered the features I was interested in, there are plenty of other things
you can look at on the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bullseye.com/">official website</a>.</p>
<p>However, if you don't need the extra features such as the visualizer (or use
something like Sonar for this), or the merge or code excluding, it's probably
not worth paying the price for it. In my case, since the merge is not better
than my C++ tool (both do almost the same and my tool does some basic line
coverage merging as well) and I don't need the visualizer, I won't pay the price
for it. Moreover, they don't have student or open source licensing, therefore,
I'll continue with my complicated toolchain :)</p>

<div class="p-summary">
        <div>
<p>I've just released the first official version of my Expression Templates Library
(ETL for short): The version 1.0.</p>
<p>Until now, I was using a simple rolling release model, but I think it's now time
to switch to some basic versioning. The project is now at a stable state.</p>
<p>ETL 1.0 has the following main features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Smart Expression Templates</li>
<li>Matrix and vector (runtime-sized and compile-time-sized)</li>
<li>Simple element-wise operations</li>
<li>Reductions (sum, mean, max, ...)</li>
<li>Unary operations (sigmoid, log, exp, abs, ...)</li>
<li>Matrix multiplication</li>
<li>Convolution (1D and 2D and higher variations)</li>
<li>Max Pooling</li>
<li>Fast Fourrier Transform</li>
<li>Use of SSE/AVX to speed up operations</li>
<li>Use of BLAS/MKL/CUBLAS/CUFFT/CUDNN libraries to speed up operations</li>
<li>Symmetric matrix adapter (experimental)</li>
<li>Sparse matrix (experimental)</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="examples">
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Here is an example of expressions in ETL:</p>

<p>Or another I'm using in my neural networks library:</p>

</pre>
<p>In that case, the vector-matrix multiplication will be executed using a BLAS
kernel (if ETL is configured correclty) and the assignment, the sigmoid and the
addition will be automatically vectorized to use either AVX or SSE depending
on the machine.</p>
<p>Or with a convolutional layer and a ReLU activation function:</p>
<pre class="code cpp"><a name="rest_code_f9cc8d1b78074415a3b28f7fbc958f1c-1"></a><span class="n">etl</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">reshape</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">K</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">NH1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">NH2</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">h_a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">etl</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">conv_4d_valid_flipped</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">etl</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">reshape</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">NC</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">NV1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">NV2</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">v_a</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">w</span><span class="p">);</span>

</pre>
<p>This will automatically be computed either with NVIDIA CUDNN (if available) or
with optimized SSE/AVX kernels.</p>
<p>For more information, you can take a look at the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl/wiki">Reference</a> on the wiki.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="next-version">
<h2>Next version</h2>
<p>For the next version, I'll focus on several things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Improve matrix-matrix multiplication kernels when BLAS is not available. There
is a lot of room for improvement here</li>
<li>Complete support for symmetric matrices (currently experimental)</li>
<li>Maybe some new adapters such as Hermitian matrices</li>
<li>GPU improvements for some operations that can be done entirely on GPU</li>
<li>New convolution performanceimprovements</li>
<li>Perhaps more complete parallel support for some implementations</li>
<li>Drop some compiler support to use full C++14 support</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="download-etl">
<h2>Download ETL</h2>
<p>You can download ETL <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl">on Github</a>. If you
only interested in the 1.0 version, you can look at the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl/releases">Releases pages</a> or clone the tag
1.0. There are several branches:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<em>master</em> Is the eternal development branch, may not always be stable</li>
<li>
<em>stable</em> Is a branch always pointing to the last tag, no development here</li>
</ul>
<p>For the future release, there always will tags pointing to the corresponding
commits. I'm not following the git flow way, I'd rather try to have a more
linear history with one eternal development branch, rather than an useless
develop branch or a load of other branches for releases.</p>
<p>Don't hesitate to comment this post if you have any comment on this library or
any question. You can also open an Issue on Github if you have a problem using
this library or propose a Pull Request if you have any contribution you'd like
to make to the library.</p>
<p>Hope this may be useful to some of you :)</p>

        <br><small>  
             Posted: <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2016-08-27T22:28:16+02:00">2016-08-27 22:28</time></small>

<div class="p-summary">
        <div>
<p>I have updated my asgard project to make it finally useful for me, so I figured
I'd present the project now.</p>
<p>Asgard is my project of home automation based on a Raspberry Pi. I started this
project after Ninja Blocks kickstarter company went down and I was left with
useless sensors. So I figured why not have fun creating my own :P I know there
are some other projects out there that are pretty good, but I wanted to do some
more low level stuff for once, so what the hell.</p>
<p>Of course, everything is written in C++, no surprise here. The project is built
upon a server / drivers architecture. The drivers and the server are talking via
network sockets, so they can be on different machines.  The server is displaying
the data it got on a web interface and also provide a way to trigger actions of
drivers either from the web interface or through the integrated rules engine.
The data are stored in a database, accessed with CPPSqlite3 (probably going to
be replaced by sqlcpp11) and the web server is handled with mongoose (with a c++
interface).</p>
<p>I must mention that most of the web part of the project was made by a student of
mine, Stéphane Ly, who work on it as part of his study.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of the Raspberry Pi system (not very pretty ;) ):</p>
<img alt="Asgard automation system hardware" class="align-center" src="images/asgard_hardware.jpg"><p>I plan to try to fit at least some of it on a nicer box with nicer cables and
such. Moreover, I also plan to add real antennas to the RF transmitter and
receiver, but I haven't received them so far.</p>
<div class="section" id="sensors">
<h2>Sensors</h2>
<p>asgard support several sensors:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>DHT11 Temperature/Humdity Sensor</li>
<li>WT450 Temperature/Humdity Sensor</li>
<li>RF Button</li>
<li>IR Remote</li>
<li>CPU Temperature Sensor</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the sensors data displayed on the web interface:</p>
<img alt="Asgard automation system home page" class="align-center" src="images/asgard_home.png">
</div>
<div class="section" id="actions">
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>There are currently a few actions provided by the drivers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Wake-On-Lan a computer by its MAC Address</li>
<li>ITT-1500 smart plugs ON and OFF</li>
<li>Kodi actions: Pause / Play / Next / Previous on Kodi</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the rules engine:</p>
<img alt="Asgard automation system rules page" class="align-center" src="images/asgard_rules.png">
</div>
<div class="section" id="my-home-automation">
<h2>My home automation</h2>
<p>I'm currently using this system to monitor the temperature in my appartment.
Nothing great so far because I don't have enough sensors yet. And now, I'm also
using a wireless button to turn on my power socket, wait 2 seconds and then
power on my Kodi Home Theater with wake on lan.</p>
<p>It's nothing fancy so far, but it's already better than what I had with Ninja
Blocks, except for the ugly hardware ;).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="future">
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>There are still tons of work on the project and on integration in my home.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I'm really dissatisfied with the WT450 sensor, I've ordered new Oregon sensors to try to do better.</li>
<li>I've ordered a few new sensors: Door intrusion detector and motion detector</li>
<li>The rules system needs to be improve to support multiple conditions</li>
<li>I plan to add a simple state system to the asgard server</li>
<li>There are a lot of refactorings necessary in the code and</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I don't know when I'll work on this again, my work on this project is
pretty episodic to say the least.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code">
<h2>Code</h2>
<p>The code is, as always, available on Github. There are multiple repositories:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Awichtounet+asgard">all asgard repositories</a>.
It's not that much code for now, about 2000 lines of code, but some of it may be
useful. If you plan to use the system, keep in mind that it was never tested out
of my environment and that there is no documentation so far, but don't hesitate
to open Issues on Github if you have questions or post a comment here.</p>

<p>Since it's been a real while since the last post I've written here, I wanted to
write a short status update.</p>
<p>I had to serve one month in the army, which does not help at all for
productivity :P Since the update to Boost Spirit X3, I haven't worked on my
eddic compiler again, but I've switched back to my operating system project:
thor. I'm having a lot of fun with it again and it's in much better state than
before.</p>
<p>We also have been very productive on the publication side, with four new
publications this year in various conferences. I'll update the blog when the
proceedings are published. I'll be going to ICANN 2016 and ANNPR 2016 next week
and probably to ICFHR in October. And of course, I'll go back to Meeting C++ in
November :) As for my thesis, it's finally going great, I've started writing
regularly and it's taking form!</p>
<div class="section" id="thor">
<h2>Thor</h2>
<p>My project Thor Operating System now has much more features than before:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>64bit operating system</li>
<li>Preemptive Multiprocessing</li>
<li>Keyboard / Mouse driver</li>
<li>Full ACPI support with ACPICA</li>
<li>Read/Write ATA driver</li>
<li>FAT32 file system support</li>
<li>HPET/RTC/PIT drivers</li>
<li>Basic PCI support</li>
<li>Multi stage booting with FAT32</li>
</ul>
<p>Since last time, I've fixed tons of bug in the system. Although there are still
some culprit, it's much more stable than before. They were a lot of bugs in the
scheduler with loads of race conditions. I hope I've working through most of
them now.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on the network stack. I'm able to receive and send packets
using the Realtek 8139 card. I have working support for Ethernet, IP and ARP.
I'm currently working on adding ICMP support. I've come to realize that the
hardest part is not to develop the code here but to find a way to test it.
Network in Qemu is a huge pain in the ass to configure. And then, you need tools
to generate some packets or at least answer to packets send by the virtual
machine, and it's really bad... Nevertheless, it's pretty fun overall :)</p>
<p>Aside from this, I'm also working on a window manager. I'll try to post an
update on this.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/thor-os">thor sources</a> if you're interested.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="future">
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>For the time being, I'll focus my effort on the thor project. I also have some
development to do on my home automation system: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/asgard-server">asgard-server</a> that I plan to finalize and deploy in a useful way this weekend in my apartment. You can also expect some updates on my deep learning library where I've started work to make it more user-friendly (kind of). I'm also still waiting on the first stable version of doctest for a new comparison with Catch.</p>
<p>I really want to try to publish again some more posts on the blog. I'll
especially try to publish some more updates about Thor.</p>
