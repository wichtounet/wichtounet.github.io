        <div>
<p>I have updated my asgard project to make it finally useful for me, so I figured
I'd present the project now.</p>
<p>Asgard is my project of home automation based on a Raspberry Pi. I started this
project after Ninja Blocks kickstarter company went down and I was left with
useless sensors. So I figured why not have fun creating my own :P I know there
are some other projects out there that are pretty good, but I wanted to do some
more low level stuff for once, so what the hell.</p>
<p>Of course, everything is written in C++, no surprise here. The project is built
upon a server / drivers architecture. The drivers and the server are talking via
network sockets, so they can be on different machines.  The server is displaying
the data it got on a web interface and also provide a way to trigger actions of
drivers either from the web interface or through the integrated rules engine.
The data are stored in a database, accessed with CPPSqlite3 (probably going to
be replaced by sqlcpp11) and the web server is handled with mongoose (with a c++
interface).</p>
<p>I must mention that most of the web part of the project was made by a student of
mine, Stéphane Ly, who work on it as part of his study.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of the Raspberry Pi system (not very pretty ;) ):</p>
<img alt="Asgard automation system hardware" class="align-center" src="images/asgard_hardware.jpg"><p>I plan to try to fit at least some of it on a nicer box with nicer cables and
such. Moreover, I also plan to add real antennas to the RF transmitter and
receiver, but I haven't received them so far.</p>
<div class="section" id="sensors">
<h2>Sensors</h2>
<p>asgard support several sensors:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>DHT11 Temperature/Humdity Sensor</li>
<li>WT450 Temperature/Humdity Sensor</li>
<li>RF Button</li>
<li>IR Remote</li>
<li>CPU Temperature Sensor</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the sensors data displayed on the web interface:</p>
<img alt="Asgard automation system home page" class="align-center" src="images/asgard_home.png">
</div>
<div class="section" id="actions">
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>There are currently a few actions provided by the drivers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Wake-On-Lan a computer by its MAC Address</li>
<li>ITT-1500 smart plugs ON and OFF</li>
<li>Kodi actions: Pause / Play / Next / Previous on Kodi</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the rules engine:</p>
<img alt="Asgard automation system rules page" class="align-center" src="images/asgard_rules.png">
</div>
<div class="section" id="my-home-automation">
<h2>My home automation</h2>
<p>I'm currently using this system to monitor the temperature in my appartment.
Nothing great so far because I don't have enough sensors yet. And now, I'm also
using a wireless button to turn on my power socket, wait 2 seconds and then
power on my Kodi Home Theater with wake on lan.</p>
<p>It's nothing fancy so far, but it's already better than what I had with Ninja
Blocks, except for the ugly hardware ;).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="future">
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>There are still tons of work on the project and on integration in my home.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I'm really dissatisfied with the WT450 sensor, I've ordered new Oregon sensors to try to do better.</li>
<li>I've ordered a few new sensors: Door intrusion detector and motion detector</li>
<li>The rules system needs to be improve to support multiple conditions</li>
<li>I plan to add a simple state system to the asgard server</li>
<li>There are a lot of refactorings necessary in the code and</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I don't know when I'll work on this again, my work on this project is
pretty episodic to say the least.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code">
<h2>Code</h2>
<p>The code is, as always, available on Github. There are multiple repositories:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Awichtounet+asgard">all asgard repositories</a>.
It's not that much code for now, about 2000 lines of code, but some of it may be
useful. If you plan to use the system, keep in mind that it was never tested out
of my environment and that there is no documentation so far, but don't hesitate
to open Issues on Github if you have questions or post a comment here.</p>

<p>Since it's been a real while since the last post I've written here, I wanted to
write a short status update.</p>
<p>I had to serve one month in the army, which does not help at all for
productivity :P Since the update to Boost Spirit X3, I haven't worked on my
eddic compiler again, but I've switched back to my operating system project:
thor. I'm having a lot of fun with it again and it's in much better state than
before.</p>
<p>We also have been very productive on the publication side, with four new
publications this year in various conferences. I'll update the blog when the
proceedings are published. I'll be going to ICANN 2016 and ANNPR 2016 next week
and probably to ICFHR in October. And of course, I'll go back to Meeting C++ in
November :) As for my thesis, it's finally going great, I've started writing
regularly and it's taking form!</p>
<div class="section" id="thor">
<h2>Thor</h2>
<p>My project Thor Operating System now has much more features than before:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>64bit operating system</li>
<li>Preemptive Multiprocessing</li>
<li>Keyboard / Mouse driver</li>
<li>Full ACPI support with ACPICA</li>
<li>Read/Write ATA driver</li>
<li>FAT32 file system support</li>
<li>HPET/RTC/PIT drivers</li>
<li>Basic PCI support</li>
<li>Multi stage booting with FAT32</li>
</ul>
<p>Since last time, I've fixed tons of bug in the system. Although there are still
some culprit, it's much more stable than before. They were a lot of bugs in the
scheduler with loads of race conditions. I hope I've working through most of
them now.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on the network stack. I'm able to receive and send packets
using the Realtek 8139 card. I have working support for Ethernet, IP and ARP.
I'm currently working on adding ICMP support. I've come to realize that the
hardest part is not to develop the code here but to find a way to test it.
Network in Qemu is a huge pain in the ass to configure. And then, you need tools
to generate some packets or at least answer to packets send by the virtual
machine, and it's really bad... Nevertheless, it's pretty fun overall :)</p>
<p>Aside from this, I'm also working on a window manager. I'll try to post an
update on this.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/thor-os">thor sources</a> if you're interested.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="future">
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>For the time being, I'll focus my effort on the thor project. I also have some
development to do on my home automation system: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/asgard-server">asgard-server</a> that I plan to finalize and deploy in a useful way this weekend in my apartment. You can also expect some updates on my deep learning library where I've started work to make it more user-friendly (kind of). I'm also still waiting on the first stable version of doctest for a new comparison with Catch.</p>
<p>I really want to try to publish again some more posts on the blog. I'll
especially try to publish some more updates about Thor.</p>
