I'm Baptiste Wicht, from Switzerland, now 28 years old. Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D
student in Computer Science at the University of applied sciences in Fribourg,
principally in Machine Learning. Currently, I'm mainly developing high
performance applications in C++.

I've started programming in 2004, when doing my computer science apprentice
ship. For a few years, I programmed a lot in Java and become involved in the
french Developpez.com community, for which I was a writer and moderator on the
forums and finally a Java Community Leader for the complete Java community on
Developpez.com.

Later, in 2011, I find the holy Grail of the programming languages when
I started to work with C++ for my Bachelor's Thesis project and since this time
I've only been writing in C++. I've even written my own compiler and my own
operating system. For more information on my projects, you can have a look at
the [Projects page](/projects/). I'm also teaching an advanced C++ course for
Bachelor students.

For my Ph.D., I've been working on Machine Learning experiments. For
this, I've developed an entire machine learning framework with
highly-optimized kernels for CPU and a prototype version for GPU. The
framework mainly focuses on neural networks, convolutional neural
networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines.

As for my other interests, I'm a fan of Linux and especially Gentoo. Recently,
I've become also quite interested in home automation technologies and I've
started testing a few devices in my apartment.

A (short) list of my publication is available on the [Publications page](/publications/).
