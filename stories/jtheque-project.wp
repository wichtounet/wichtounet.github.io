It a parent project for several projects I've made:

<ul>
	<li><strong>JTheque Core</strong> : A framework to create modular Java Desktop applications</li>
	<li><strong>JTheque Utils </strong>: A collection of utility classes to facilitate the development of Java applications</li>
	<li><strong>JTheque XML Utils</strong> : A simple library to write and read XML files using JDOM or the javax.xml package</li>
	<li>Several applications including an application to manage movies, another to manage films or an application to generate metrics for a Java project.</li>
</ul>
