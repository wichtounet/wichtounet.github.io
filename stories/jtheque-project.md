**JTheque** is a personal project I've developed for several years now.

It a parent project for several projects I've made:

* **JTheque Core** : A framework to create modular Java Desktop applications
* **JTheque Utils**: A collection of utility classes to facilitate the development of Java applications
* **JTheque XML Utils**: A simple library to write and read XML files using JDOM or the javax.xml package
* Several applications including an application to manage movies, another to manage films or an application to generate metrics for a Java project.

The repositories are available on my [Github repositories](http://github.com/wichtounet/).
