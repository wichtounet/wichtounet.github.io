        <small>  
             Posted: <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2010-04-21T06:06:58+00:00">2010-04-21 06:06</time>
        </small></h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="e-content">
        <div><p></p><div>Like I've said in other post, <a href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/03/nio-2-path-api-java-7/">we will have a new API to access File System in Java 7</a>, but we'll have several others new features in NIO.2 that I've not covered</div>
So I'll try to cover them in that post. Indeed the <strong>JSR 203</strong> (also known as <strong>NIO.2</strong>) add several new classes that improve I/O code.
<p>In this post I cover the following features :</p>
<ul>
    <li>SeekableByteChannel : A random access channel</li>
    <li>MulticastChannel : A channel that allow for IP multicasting</li>
    <li>NetworkChannel : The new super interface for the network-oriented channels</li>
    <li>Asynchronous I/O API : The new API to make I/O operations in an asynchronous way.</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<p><strong>SeekableByteChannel</strong></p>
<p>First of all, the Java 7 includes a new ByteChannel, the <strong>SeekableByteChannel</strong>. This Channel maintains a current position, so you can read and write from this position. That allows <strong>random access</strong> positions. With that type of Channel, you can even add several threads reading/writing the same threads at different positions.</p>
<p>[java]SeekableByteChannel channel1 = Paths.get("Path to file").newByteChannel(); //Simply READ</p>
<p>SeekableByteChannel channel2 = Paths.get("Path to file").newByteChannel(StandardOpenOption.READ, StandardOpenOption.WRITE); //READ and WRITE[/java]</p>
<p>You can use these methods to manipulate the positions and size of the channel :</p>
<ul>
    <li>long position() : Return the current position</li>
    <li>long size() : Return the current size of the entity this channel is connected to, by example the size of the file the channel is connecting to</li>
    <li>position(long newPosition) : Move the current position to the given one</li>
    <li>truncate(long size) : Truncates the entity to the given size.</li>
</ul>

<p>The position() and truncate() methods simply returns the current Channel to allow chained invocations.</p>
<p>Now, <strong>FileChannel</strong> implements this new interface, so you can make random access with all FileChannels.</p>
<p>You can of course read a file with that channel :</p>
<p>[java]SeekableByteChannel channel = null;</p>
<p>try {
    channel = Paths.get("Path to file").newByteChannel(StandardOpenOption.READ);
    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(4096);</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="n">System</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">out</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"File size: "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">channel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">size</span><span class="p">());</span>

<span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">channel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">buffer</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">amp</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">gt</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="n">buffer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">flip</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("Expection when reading : " + e.getMessage());
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    if (sbc != null){
        channel.close();
    }
}[/java]</p>
<h4>MulticastChannel</h4>

<p>This new interface enable to make Internet Protocol (IP) <strong>Multicasting</strong>. So you can send and receive IP datagrams from a complete group. The multicast implementations are directly bind to the native multicast facility. This interface is implement by DatagramChannel and AsynchronousDatagramChannel.</p>
<p>A simple example taken from the Javadoc to open a DatagramChannel t :</p>
<p>[java]NetworkInterface networkInterface = NetworkInterface.getByName("hme0");</p>
<p>DatagramChannel dc = DatagramChannel.open(StandardProtocolFamily.INET)
         .setOption(StandardSocketOption.SO_REUSEADDR, true)
         .bind(new InetSocketAddress(5000))
         .setOption(StandardSocketOption.IP_MULTICAST_IF, networkInterface);</p>
<p>InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("225.4.5.6");</p>
<p>MembershipKey key = dc.join(group, networkInterface);[/java]</p>
<p>With that, you can use your DatagramChannel as all others DatagramChannel you used in the past, but the operations are made with multicast, so you receive all the packets of the interface and you send packets to all the group.</p>
<h4>NetworkChannel</h4>

<p>Now, all the network-oriented channels implements the new <strong>NetworkChannel</strong> interface. With that, you easily bind the channel socket, set and query for socket options. Furthermore, the socket optioins are now extensible, so you can use operating system specific options, that could be interesting for high performances servers.</p>
<h4>Asynchronous I/O</h4>

<p>And after that little introduction, we go to the main new feature : The new <strong>Asynchronous I/O API</strong>. Its name indicate all the purpose of this new features, indeed enable Asynchronous I/O operations.This new channels provide <strong>asynchronous operations</strong> for both sockets and files.</p>
<p>Of course, all that operations are non-blocking, but there is also blocking operations that you can do with all the asynchronous channels.</p>
<p>All the asynchronous I/O operations have one of two forms :</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first one returns a java.util.concurrent.Future that represent the pending result. You can use that Future to wait for the I/O operations to finish.</li>
    <li>The second one is created using  a CompletionHandler. That handler is invoked when the operation is has completed, like callbacks systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>So here are the examples of the two forms :</p>
<p>The first form, using Future :</p>
<p>[java]AsynchronousFileChannel channel = AsynchronousFileChannel.open(Paths.get("Path to file"));</p>
<p>ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(capacity);</p>
<p>Future result = channel.read(buffer, 100); //Read capacity bytes from the file starting at position 100</p>
<p>boolean done = result.isDone(); //Indicate if the result is already terminated&lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>You can also wait for completion :</p>
<p>[java]int bytesRead = result.get();[/java]</p>
<p>Or wait with a timeout :</p>
<p>[java]int bytesRead = result.get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); //Wait at most 10 seconds on the result[/java]</p>
<p>The second form, using CompletionHandler :</p>
<p>[java]Future result = channel.read(buffer, 100, null, new CompletionHandler(){
    public void completed(Integer result, Object attachement){
        //Compute the result
    }</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="n">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">failed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Throwable</span> <span class="n">exception</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Object</span> <span class="n">attachement</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="c1">//Answer to the fail</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>}[/java]</p>
<p>As you can see, you can give an attachement to the operation. This attachement is given to the CompletionHandler at the end of the operation. You can give null as attachement with no problem. But you can pass anything you want, like the Connection for a AsynchronousSocketChannel or the ByteBuffer for our read :</p>
<p>[java]Future result = channel.read(buffer, 100, buffer, new CompletionHandler(){
    public void completed(Integer result, ByteBuffer buffer){
        //Compute the result
    }</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="n">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">failed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Throwable</span> <span class="n">exception</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ByteBuffer</span> <span class="n">buffer</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="c1">//Answer to the fail</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>}[/java]</p>
<p>And as you can see, the form with the CompletionHandle gives also you a Future element representing the pending result, so you can merge the two forms.</p>
<p>Here, are all the asynchronous channels available in NIO.2 :</p>
<ul>

<ul>
    <li>AsynchronousFileChannel : An asynchronous channel for reading and writing from and to a file. This channel has no global positions, so each read/write operations needs a position to operate. You can access concurrently to different parts of the file using different threads. You have to specify the options (READ, WRITE, but not APPEND) when you open this channel.</li>
    <li>AsynchronousSocketChannel : A simple asynchronous channel to a Socket. The connect, read/write and scatter/gather methods are all asynchronous. The read/write method supports timeouts.</li>
    <li>AsynchronousServerSocketChannel : An asynchronous channel to a ServerSocket. The accept() method is asynchronous and the CompletionHandler is called when a connection has been accepted. The result of this kind of connection is an AsynchronousSocketChannel.</li>
    <li>AsynchronousDatagramChannel :</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>An channel to datagram-oriented socket. The read/write (connected) and receive/send (unconnected) methods are asynchronous.</p>
<h4>Groups</h4>

<p>When you use AsynchronousChannels, there is of course threads that invoke the completion handlers. These threads are bound to an AsynchronousChannelGroup. This group contains a thread pool and encapsulates the resources shared by all the threads working for the channels. You can greate these groups using thread pool. The AsynchronousFileChannel can be created with its own group, passing an ExecutorService as argument to the open() method. The channels are created using an AsynchronousChannelGroup in the open method, if you don't give it a group or you pass null, the default group is used. The channel is said to be owned by the group, so, if the group is closed, the channel is closed too.</p>
<p>You can create a group with a ThreadFactory :</p>
<p>[java]ThreadFactory myThreadFactory = Executors.defaultThreadFactory();</p>
<p>AsynchronousChannelGroup channelGroup = AsynchronousChannelGroup.withFixedThreadPool(25, myThreadFactory);[/java]</p>
<p>Or with an ExecutorService :</p>
<p>ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(25);</p>
<p>[java]AsynchronousChannelGroup channelGroup = AsynchronousChannelGroup.withThreadPool(service);[/java]</p>
<p>And you easily use it :</p>
<p>[java]AsynchronousSocketChannel socketChannel = AsynchronousSocketChannel.open(channelGroup);[/java]</p>
<p>You can close the group using the shutdown() method on the group. After that, you cannot create more channels using this group and the group effectively terminates when all the channels are closed, the completion handlers terminated and the resources released.</p>
<p>You must give attention to a points when you use any type of pools and CompletionHandler : DO NOT USE blocking or long operation inside a CompletionHandler. That can block the entire application if all the threads are blocking. If you've custom or cached thread pool, that can make the queue growing infinitely and cause OutOfMemoryError.</p>
<p>I think (and I hope), I've covered the main news from this new Asynchronous I/O API. This is not simple stuff of course and that will not be used by every one but that can be useful in several cases and it's a good thing that Java will have this kind of I/O. I therefore apologize if I made some errors in my code or my explanations, is not a easy subject and I tried to explain it for everyone.</p>
<p>You have also others informations in <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/nio/presentations/TS-4222.pdf">the overview of Asynchronous I/O at JavaOne 2009</a>, by Alan Bateman and Jean-François Arcand.</p></div>

<!--more-->

<p></p><h4>Diamond Syntax</h4>
<p>This feature is a really simple syntax improvement for generics. With that feature, you can avoid to write twice the generics type in a generics declaration. A little  example :</p>
<p>Instead of writing this :</p>
<p>[java]Map&lt;String, Collection&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; map = new LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Collection&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;();[/java]</p>
<p>You can now write that :</p>
<p>[java]Map&lt;String, Collection&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; map = new LinkedHashMap&lt;&gt;();[/java]</p>
<p>That's really practical, but not essential.</p>
<h4>Simplified Varargs Method Invocation</h4>

<p>This improvement is not a new functionality, but only a move of a warning. Like you must know, we cannot create arrray of generics type because the type verification is not made at the same time. But with the Ellipse of Java 5, you can made that type of array implicitely and the compiler generate warning at each invocation of that kind of method, so the warning has moved to the method declaration to have less warnings.</p>
<h4>Integers declaration</h4>

<p>You'll can declare integers using binary values :</p>
<p>[java]int binary = 0b11001001001;[/java]</p>
<p>and you can use _ (underscores) in the declaration :</p>
<p>[java]double amount = 1_999_888_777.25;</p>
<p>int color = 0xdd_dd_dd;</p>
<p>int binary = 0b110_0100_1001;[/java]</p>
<p>That's allow to make more verbose code, but it's only sugar.</p>
<h4>Collections manipulations and declaration</h4>

<p>Another improvements to code verbosity, is the support of collections in the language. You'll have code facility to access and edit indexed collections like list and maps and to declare easily collections.</p>
<p>First, you can access to an element using the same syntax as the array :</p>
<p>[java]List&lt;String&gt; list = ...;</p>
<p>Map&lt;String, String&gt; map = ...;</p>
<p>String firstValue = list[0];</p>
<p>map["Test"] = firstValue;</p>
<p>String valueFromMap = map["Test"];</p>
<p>[/java]</p>
<p>For the maps, that works with any type of key. So if you have one of your class for key, you can directly pass it in the code like the Strings in my example.</p>
<p>And, you can also quickly declare collections like array :</p>
<p>Lists with [] :</p>
<p>[java]List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = [ 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 ];[/java]</p>
<p>Sets with {}</p>
<p>[java]Set&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = { 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 };[/java]</p>
<p>And Maps with {} and : to split value and key :</p>
<p>[java]Map&lt;String, String&gt; translations = {
  "Hi" : "Bonjour",
  "Goodbye" : "Au revoir",
  "Thanks" : "Merci"
} [/java]</p>
<p>All that created collections are immutables.</p>
<h4>Strings switch</h4>

<p>A really good feature : Switch with Strings values. You can now do that kind of switch : ¨</p>
<p>[java]String value = "";</p>
<p>switch (language) {
  case "fr":
    value = "Bonjour";
    break;
  case "en":
    value = "Hi";
    break;
  case "de":
    value = "Guten tag";
    break;
  default:
    value = "Hello";
    break;
}[/java]</p>
<p>I thinks, it's really great. With that, we can delete a lot of ugly list of if/else if code.</p>
<h4>Automatic Resource Management (ARM)</h4>

<p>Another great feature, you can automatically close the resources using a new try clause :</p>
<p>[java]public void write(URL url, File file) throws IOException {
  try ( FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file); InputStream is = url.openStream() ) {
    byte[] buf = new byte[2048];
    int len;
    while ((len = is.read(buf)) &amp;gt; 0) {
      fos.write(buf, 0, len);
    }
}[/java]</p>
<p>In that code, the FileOutputStream and the InputStream will automatically be closed after the try, making a cleared code and you cannot forgot a resource with that.</p>
<p>And last, the modifications to support the JSR 292 directly in the language. I've already described that features in other post : <a title="Java 7 : More dynamics" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/04/java-7-more-dynamics/" target="_self">Java 7 : More Dynamics</a></p>
<p>That's all for these new language enhancements from the Project Coin.</p>
<p>For me, i like the new ARM and the Strings Switch, but i think this is simple enhancements, they were others proposals in the Project Coin i found better, like the "Improved Exception Handling for Java", "Improved Wildcard Syntax for Java" or "Elvis and Other Null-Safe Operators", but this a good start.</p></div>

        <small>  
             Posted: <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2010-04-18T10:57:50+00:00">2010-04-18 10:57</time>
        </small></h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="e-content">
        <div><p></p><p>Like you perhaps know, i'm currently <a title="JTheque is going to OSGi" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/03/jtheque-is-going-to-osgi/" target="_self">migrating JTheque to OSGi</a>. During this migration i found several problems in the JTheque architecture that made the migration impossible without changing some concepts. In this post I'll detail all the problems I found.</p>
<!--more-->

<p></p><h5>Resources</h5>
<p>First of all, i had to completely change the way to cache resources. Before, i used a ResourceManager to cache images/icons. To get an image/icon, i gave to it the path to the resource and the manager made the rest. I used Spring to load the resources (using the Resource class). That worked well because all the modules and the core were in the same application context.</p>
<p>But now, there is an application context for each OSGi bundle, so that doesn't work at all. So i had to find an other way. The manager cannot load the resources because they're accessible from the other bundles. So I changes the way the manager works :</p>
<ol>
    <li>The modules must register all the resources they need in the resource manager. They can always use Spring to load the resource or direct use the Resource class to load it.</li>
    <li>When the module need an image/icon, it ask the resource manager. The manager watch on the cache (the cache associates the Resource to the loaded image/icon) if the image is already cached. If it's cached, it directly return the image else, it load the image from the resource and return the loaded image</li>
</ol>

<p>In that way, the resource manager doesn't have to access directly to resources on other bundles and everything works well.</p>
<h4>States</h4>

<p>The states are a way to store configuration for the modules. Before, the states must implements an interface and when they we're saved, the class were saved in a file and at startup created by reflection. But that's was not possible anymore, because the class was not accessible from the state bundle.</p>
<p>So I changed the way the data were saved using directly methods of the interface to get the stored data and to restore them at startup. Moreover, I also replaced the interface by annotations.</p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>

<p>More than these other major changes, i've also some others problems :</p>
<ul>
    <li>The JDBC driver class was not accessible. I add the package import to the manifest headers and get the driver version from SpringSource Repository to works with OSGi</li>
    <li>Substance doesn't work anymore. At this time, i don't know i that comes from OSGi or from other changes i made in the application, but i've not solved this problem.</li>
</ul>

        <small>  
             Posted: <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2010-04-16T06:24:53+00:00">2010-04-16 06:24</time>

        <div class="e-content">
        <div><p></p><p>More than provide an extremely powerful search engine used by almost everybody, <strong>Google</strong> provides also a lot of very useful tools. In this post, i list the 10 most useful Google tools from my point of view.
</p><h4>1. Gmail</h4>
<p>For me, this is the best email client ever. The interface is quick and reactive and there are many interesting features. The spam filter is really powerful, i have no more spams since i've switched to GMail a long time ago. The storage capacity (~7.4 Go) is also totally enough. Moreover, this client is totally integrated with the other tools of the Google network (Documents, Buzz, Agenda, ...). With the plugins, you can also add several others features to GMail including integrating with other tools like RememberTheMilk by example.</p>
<p>The included chat is also a great functionality. I use it everyday.</p>
<p>No more spam with : <a href="http://www.google.com/mail/" target="_blank">Google Mail</a></p>
<!--more-->

<h4>2. Google Chrome</h4>

<p>Certainly the most efficient browser. The performances of this browser are simply amazing.</p>
<p>There are perhaps less plugins now that in Firefox, but it's a lot more lighter than the others browsers.  The tab system is really well done. If a site crashes, you can simply close the tabs ands that's fine. You can also move a tab to an other window with drag&amp;drop facilities.</p>
<p>In the last months, the number of modules tend to grow quickly and provides the more useful plugins that we could have used in other browsers before switching to Chrome. And Google Chrome support without plugins the synchronization of bookmarks and execution of GreaseMonkey scripts.</p>
<p>And last but not least, this is the most simplistic (not pejorative at all) browser i use and really easy and comfortable to use.</p>
<p>Try it and why not like it : <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a></p>
<h4>3. Google Analytics</h4>

<p>Google Analytics is a really great web analytics solution. This is the most used solution. This tool is free for website with less than 5 million page views by month or for those who have an AdWords account. The interface is really simple to use but powerful. All the stats are displayed with number metrics and graphs. And, really important, the traffic analyzer is powerful and light. You can even use an asynchronous JavaScript code to produce less overhead on the page load time.</p>
<p>You can create scheduled reports and email it at a specific time rate. You can also analyze only a fragment of the traffic and follow accomplishments of objectives. You can also use Google Analytics from other languages like PHP.</p>
<p>For me, as a webmaster, this tool is completely essential and I cannot live without it (exaggerate, but I use it everyday).</p>
<p>If you try it, you will not regret : <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a></p>
<h4>4. Google Reader</h4>

<p>Google Reader is a web aggregator to read RSS and Atom. This web application can work in offline mode accessing all the previously downloaded articles.</p>
<p>More to be an aggregator, Google Reader has also social network features. In fact, you can share you favorite articles and comment them. You can access to the shared articles of your friends.</p>
<p>You can create folders to sort your subscriptions by theme (or any kind of sort you  like) and quickly find what's new in any folder. Google Reader can also give you a list of subscriptions take can interest you based on your current subscriptions themes.</p>
<p>Aggregate your RSS and Atom : <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/" target="_blank">Google Reader</a></p>
<h4>5. Google Webmaster Tools</h4>

<p>Google Webmaster Tools is an essential tools for all webmaster. With it, you can manage all your websites.</p>
<p>First of all, you can verify how your site is referenced on Google Search Engine. You can see in which position you are for the most important query for your website. You can see which keywords are the significant for your pages, you can obtain the number of links pointing to your website and to which pages there is the more links. You can also notify Google for updates in your sitemaps. Your internal links are also displayed. You can even consult the Google Reader subcribers to your feeds.</p>
<p>Next, you have also diagnostics about your site. The available diagnostics are the malware detected by the Google robots, crawl errors and crawl stats. Google Webmaster Tools give you some suggestions about your HTML pages.</p>
<p>You will love : <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/" target="_blank">Google Webmaster Tools</a></p>
<h4>6. Google Documents</h4>

<p>Google Documents is an online documents sharing application. In that application, you can create and share documents, presentation, spreadsheets, forms and drawings.</p>
<p>More than creating and editing the documents, you  can sharing them to anybody that have a Google Acount. The documents are saved by revisions and you can come back to an older revision or merge some revisions. This a really powerful feature when several persons work on the same documents.</p>
<p>All the type of documents can be edited in Wysiwyg way with powerful editors. You can also upload any files you want to your Google Documents account.</p>
<p>Try : <a href="http://docs.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Documents</a></p>
<h4>7. Google Agenda</h4>

<p>Google Agenda is a simple tools to keep appointments in mind. You have recall for your events.</p>
<p>You can create events and share them to any other Google contacts.</p>
<p>Take a look : <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar" target="_blank">Google Agenda</a></p>
<h4>8. Google Friend Connect</h4>

<p>Google Friend Connect is web tools to add social networking features to a website. You can create a community around your website. The visitors can register to your site with simple widgets and no registration using their Google, Facebook or OpenID accounts.</p>
<p>You can add a lot of widgets to your website, by example to give the users the possibility to rate your contact, ask questions to your visitors or send newsletters to them.</p>
<p>Give it a try : <a href="http://www.google.com/friendconnect/" target="_blank">Google Friend Connect</a></p>
<h4>9. Keyword Tool</h4>

<p>Keyword Tool is an application uuseful to get ideas of keywords for your website or to compare some keywords by Advertiser Competition and Search Volume. That can really help you to choose the keywords you will to focus on to improve the referencing of a website.</p>
<p>You can directly give a page of your website to the program. The page will be inspected for keywords and the tool will give you a list of keywords ideas based on the content of the site. Or you can give a list of keywords you're interested in and the program will compute a list of other keywords based on yours.</p>
<p>I think it's an essential tool for all webmaster that like to improve its websites referencing.</p>
<p>Try it : <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal" target="_blank">Google Adwords : Keyword Tool</a></p>
<h4>10. Google Language Tools</h4>

<p>Google Language Tools is a simple set of tools to translate text from a language to another. You have several choices : translate some search results, translate a complete web page or translate a given text. There is a lot of available languages. The page give also an access too Google Homepage in all languages. You can note that this tool is integrated with Google Chrome in which you can translate (automatically or manually) pages to your languages with actions in the browser.</p>
<p>Yes, this very simple, but that works well and that's really useful.</p>
<p>Try it : <a href="http://www.google.com/language_tools" target="_blank">Google Language Tools</a></p>
<p>Of course, there is a lot of others powerful Google Tools. Here are only the  most useful from my point of view. Perhaps a photograph will like Picasa, an advertiser will like AdWords and AdSense and Android, Google Maps Navigation and Google SkyMap for a mobile user.</p></div>

        <div><p></p><p>With <strong>Java 7</strong> (Dolphin), we'll have some <strong>concurrency </strong>and <strong>collections </strong>updates with the <strong>JSR166y</strong>, extension of the JSR166 of Doug Lea.</p>
<p>In this post, we'll see the most important news :</p>
<p></p><ul>
    <li>Fork/Join Framework</li>
    <li>TrasnferQueue&lt;E&gt;</li>
    <li>ThreadLocalRandom</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->

<h4>Fork/Join Framework</h4>

<p>The most important improvement is a new <strong>Fork/Join</strong> Framework. Fork/Join is basically the parralel version of the divide-and-conquer algorithm resolution. Here is the typical form of that problems (taken from Doug Lea) :</p>
<p>[java]Result solve(Problem problem) {
    if (problem is small)
        directly solve problem
    else {
        split problem into independent parts
        fork new subtasks to solve each part
        join all subtasks
        compose result from subresults
    }
}[/java]</p>
<p>Java 7 provide a new class <strong>ForkJoinPool </strong>to run <strong>ForkJoinTask</strong>. A ForkJoinTask is lighter than a thread. If you have a lot of ForkJoinTask, you can host them with a smallest number of threads. Two implementations of ForkJoinTask are provided :</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>RecursiveAction </strong>: A recursive resultless ForkJoinTask</li>
    <li><strong>RecursiveTask</strong>&lt;E&gt; : A recursive ForkJoinTask that return an object of type E</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, you can also directly use the ForkJoinTask class but the recursive actions are enough in almost all the cases.</p>
<p>From a ForkJoinTask you can invoke other task (fork them) using <em>invokeAll </em>methods.</p>
<p>So, now that we have covered the main concepts of this framework, we could start with a little example (directly taken from Javadoc <strong>build 87</strong>). We'll use divide and conquer to increment all the elements of an array. To know if the problem is small enough to solve it directly, we'll use a threshold representing the number of elements that we can increment directly. If we have more elements than the threshold, we will fork in two task otherwise, we'll compute directly the incrementation on the array. So here is our task :</p>
<p>[java]public class IncrementTask extends RecursiveAction {
   private final long[] array;
   private final int low;
   private final int high;</p>
<p>private static final int THRESHOLD = 5000;</p>
<p>public IncrementTask(long[] array, int low, int high) {
      super();</p>
<div class="code"><pre>  <span class="n">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">array</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">low</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">low</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">high</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">high</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>}</p>
<p>@Override
   protected void compute() {
      if (high - low &lt; THRESHOLD) {
           for (int i = low; i &lt; high; ++i){
              array[i]++;
           }
        } else {
           int mid = (low + high) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;</p>
<div class="code"><pre>       <span class="n">invokeAll</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="n">IncrementTask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">low</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">mid</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">new</span> <span class="n">IncrementTask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">mid</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">high</span><span class="p">));</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>}
}[/java]</p>
<p>And you can launch that on an array using ForkJoinPool :</p>
<p>[java]RecursiveAction mainTask = new IncrementTask (anArray, 0, anArray.length);</p>
<p>ForkJoinPool mainPool = new ForkJoinPool();</p>
<p>mainPool.invoke(mainTask[/java]e&gt;</p>
<p>All the elements of the array will be incremented. Depending on the size of the array and of the threshold, the problem will be divided in several sub problems and all these task will be managed by the ForkJoinPool.</p>
<p>You can also make action that return something. By example, we can compute the sum of all the elements of an array :</p>
<p>[java]public class SumTask extends RecursiveTask {
   private final long[] array;
   private final int low;
   private final int high;</p>
<p>private static final int THRESHOLD = 5000;</p>
<p>public SumTask(long[] array, int low, int high) {
      super();</p>
<div class="code"><pre>  <span class="n">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">array</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="n">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">high</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">high</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>}</p>
<p>@Override
   protected Long compute() {
      if (high - low &lt; THRESHOLD) {
          long sum = 0;</p>
<div class="code"><pre>      <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">low</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">lt</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">high</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="o">++</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">){</span>

<p>}
}[/java]</p>
<p>And you can use it like that :</p>
<p>[java]RecursiveTask sumTask = new SumTask(anArray, 0, anArray.length);</p>
<p>ForkJoinPool mainPool = new ForkJoinPool();</p>
<p>Long sum = mainPool.invoke(sumTask);[/java]</p>
<p>I think it's a clean way to solve big problems with divide-and-conquer.</p>
<p>You can also imagine others ways to divide the problems. An example is to compute the <em>THRESOLD</em> left elements in the task and create a new task to compute the right elements. With that, we create less tasks, but it depends on the context and on the problems. In practive, you'll have  normally more complex problems but if you can find a way to divide the problems, you can use that new framework and have a very clean code.</p>
<h4>TransferQueue&lt;E&gt;</h4>

<p>A new interesting collection. This collection is a blocking queue especially made for producers/consumers. With that kind of queue, the producers can await for receipt of by the consumers with a new transfer(E) method or like normal queue without waiting for receipt with the <em>put</em>(E) method. It's also possible to make a transfer with timeout with the tryTransfer method. There is no change in the consumer part, you always use take() to get an element and waiting for an element. You've also access to the number of waiting consumer with the <em>getWaitingConsumerCount</em>().</p>
<p>The implementation to use is the <strong>LinkedTransferQueue&lt;E&gt;</strong> based on linked nodes. The elements are ordered with FIFO. Here are some methods you can use with that new collection :</p>
<p>[java]TransferQueue&lt;String&gt; transfer = new LinkedTransferQueue&lt;String&gt;();</p>
<p>transfer.transfer("Hello"); //Wait for a consumer</p>
<p>if(transfer.tryTransfer("World")){//Don't wait for a consumer
    //The element has been transfered to a consumer
} else {
    //There were no waiting consumer. The element has not been enqueued.
}</p>
<p>boolean transfered = transfer.tryTransfer("Goodbye", 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);</p>
<p>while(transfer.hasWaitingConsumer()){
    //There is at least one consumer waiting for a transfer
}[/java]</p>
<p>It's also an interesting stuff. Useful by example in the case of message passing.</p>
<h4>ThreadLocalRandom</h4>

<p>A really simple but useful enhancement is the add of the <strong>ThreadLocalRandom</strong> class. This class is a random number generator linked to the current <strong>Thread</strong>. It seems that if you use this generator from two different thread, you will have two different random generators. The generator is initialized with a generated seed that you cannot modify (<em>setSeed()</em> throws an <em>UnsupportedOperationException</em>).</p>
<p>You can use that class like that :</p>
<p>[java]long l = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextLong(22L);[/java]</p>
<p>If you always use this form, you have the guarantee that the random generator will never be shared between two threads. Moreover, this new class provide  methods to generate a bounded numbers. By example, to generate a pseudo-random number between 10, inclusive and 33, exclusive, you can type :</p>
<p>[java]int i = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(10, 33);[/java]</p>
<p>This is a little improvement but really useful, i think.</p>
<p>So here we are. I've covered the main features added on Java 7 for concurrency. I hope you find that stuff interesting and that discovering this features will help you to make concurrent programming in Java 7.</p></div>
