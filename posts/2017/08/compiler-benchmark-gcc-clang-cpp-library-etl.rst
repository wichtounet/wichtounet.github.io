It's been a while since I've done a benchmark of different compilers on C++
code. Since I've recently
`released the version 1.1 of my ETL project <https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/08/expression-templates-library-etl-11.html>`_
(an optimized matrix/vector computation library with expression templates), I've
decided to use it as the base of my benchmark. It's a C++14 library with a lot
of templates. I'm going to compile the full test suite (124 test cases). This is
done directly on the last release (1.1) code. I'm going to compile once in debug
mode and once in release_debug (release plus debug symbols and assertions) and
record the times for each compiler. The tests were compiled with support for
every option in ETL to account to maximal compilation time. Each compilation was
made using four threads (make -j4). I'm also going to test a few of the
benchmarks to see the difference in runtime performance between the code
generated by each compiler. The benchmark will be compiled in release mode and
its compilation time recorded as well.

I'm going to test the following compilers:

* GCC-4.9.4
* GCC-5.4.0
* GCC-6.3.0
* GCC-7.1.0
* clang-3.9.1
* clang-4.0.1
* zapcc-1.0 (commercial, based on clang-5.0 trunk)

All have been installed directly using Portage (Gentoo package manager) except
for clang-4.0.1 that has been installed from sources and zapcc since it does not
have a Gentoo package. Since clang package on Gentoo does not support
multislotting, I had to install one version from source and the other from the
package manager. This is also the reason I'm testing less versions of clang,
simply less practical.

For the purpose of these tests, the exact same options have been used throughout
all the compilers. Normally, I use different options for clang than for GCC
(mainly more aggressive vectorization options on clang). This may not lead to
the best performance for each compiler, but allows for comparison between the
results with defaults optimization level. Here are the main options used:

* In debug mode: -g
* In release_debug mode: -g -O2
* In release mode: -g -O3 -DNDEBUG -fomit-frame-pointer

In each case, a lot of warnings are enabled and the ETL options are the same.

All the results have been gathered on a Gentoo machine running on Intel Core
i7-2600 (Sandy Bridge...) @3.4GHz with 4 cores and 8 threads, 12Go of RAM and
a SSD. I do my best to isolate as much as possible the benchmark from
perturbations and that my benchmark code is quite sound, it may well be that
some results are not totally accurate. Moreover, some of the benchmarks are
using multithreading, which may add some noise and unpredictability. When I was
not sure about the results, I ran the benchmarks several time to confirm them
and overall I'm confident of the results.

Compilation Time
++++++++++++++++

Let's start with the results of the performance of the compilers themselves:

+---------------+-------+---------------+-----------+
| Compiler      | Debug | Release_Debug | Benchmark |
+===============+=======+===============+===========+
| g++-4.9.4     | 402s  | 616s          | 100s      |
+---------------+-------+---------------+-----------+
| g++-5.4.0     | 403s  | 642s          |  95s      |
+---------------+-------+---------------+-----------+
| g++-6.3.0     | 399s  | 683s          | 102s      |
+---------------+-------+---------------+-----------+
| g++-7.1.0     | 371s  | 650s          | 105s      |
+---------------+-------+---------------+-----------+
| clang++-3.9.1 | 380s  | 807s          | 106s      |
+---------------+-------+---------------+-----------+
| clang++-4.0.1 | 260s  | 718s          |  92s      |
+---------------+-------+---------------+-----------+
| zapcc++-1.0   | 221s  | 649s          | 108s      |
+---------------+-------+---------------+-----------+

Note: For Release_Debug and Benchmark, I only use three threads with zapcc,
because 12Go of RAM is not enough memory for four threads.

There are some very significant differences between the different compilers.
Overall, clang-4.0.1 is by far the fastest free compiler for Debug mode. When
the tests are compiled with optimizations however, clang is falling behind.
It's quite impressive how clang-4.0.1 manages to be so much faster than
clang-3.9.1 both in debug mode and release mode. Really great work by the clang
team here! With these optimizations, clang-4.0.1 is almost on par with gcc-7.1
in release mode.  For GCC, it seems that the cost of optimization has been going
up quite significantly. However, GCC 7.1 seems to have made optimization faster
and standard compilation much faster as well. If we take into account zapcc,
it's the fastest compiler on debug mode, but it's slower than several gcc
versions on release mode.

Overall, I'm quite impressed by the performance of clang-4.0.1 which seems
really fast! I'll definitely make more tests with this new version of the
compiler in the near future. It's also good to see that g++-7.1 also did make
the build faster than gcc-6.3. However, the fastest gcc version for optimization
is still gcc-4.9.4 which is already an old branch with low C++ standard support.

Runtime Performance
+++++++++++++++++++

Let's now take a look at the quality of the generated code. For some of the
benchmarks, I've included two versions of the algorithm. *std* is the most
simple algorithm (the naive one) and *vec* is the hand-crafted vectorized and
optimized implementation. All the tests were done on single-precision floating
points.

Dot product
-----------

The first benchmark that is run is to compute the dot product between two
vectors. Let's look first at the naive version:

+---------------+---------+----------+----------+--------+----------+----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+----------+

The differences are not very significant between the different compilers. The
clang-based compilers seem to be the compilers producing the fastest code.
Interestingly, there seem to have been a big regression in gcc-6.3 for large
containers, but that has been fixed in gcc-7.1.

+---------------+---------+---------+----------+--------+---------+----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+----------+

+---------------+---------+---------+----------+--------+---------+----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+----------+

If we look at the optimized version, the differences are even slower. Again, the
clang-based compilers are producing the fastest executables, but are closely
followed by gcc, except for gcc-6.3 in which we can still see the same
regression as before.

Logistic Sigmoid
----------------

The next test is to check the performance of the sigmoid operation. In that
case, the evaluator of the library will try to use parallelization and
vectorization to compute it. Let's see how the different compilers fare:

+---------------+--------+--------+--------+---------+----------+---------+
| sigmoid       | 10     | 100    | 1000   | 10000   | 100000   | 1000000 |
+===============+========+========+========+=========+==========+=========+
| g++-4.9.4     | 8.16us | 5.23us | 6.33us | 29.56us | 259.72us | 2.78ms  |
+---------------+--------+--------+--------+---------+----------+---------+
| g++-5.4.0     | 7.07us | 5.08us | 6.39us | 29.44us | 266.27us | 2.96ms  |
+---------------+--------+--------+--------+---------+----------+---------+
| g++-6.3.0     | 7.13us | 5.32us | 6.45us | 28.99us | 261.81us | 2.86ms  |
+---------------+--------+--------+--------+---------+----------+---------+
| g++-7.1.0     | 7.03us | 5.09us | 6.24us | 28.61us | 252.78us | 2.71ms  |
+---------------+--------+--------+--------+---------+----------+---------+
| clang++-3.9.1 | 7.30us | 5.25us | 6.57us | 30.24us | 256.75us | 1.99ms  |
+---------------+--------+--------+--------+---------+----------+---------+
| clang++-4.0.1 | 7.47us | 5.14us | 5.77us | 26.03us | 235.87us | 1.81ms  |
+---------------+--------+--------+--------+---------+----------+---------+
| zapcc++-1.0   | 7.51us | 5.26us | 6.48us | 28.86us | 258.31us | 1.95ms  |
+---------------+--------+--------+--------+---------+----------+---------+

Interestingly, we can see that gcc-7.1 is the fastest for small vectors while
clang-4.0 is the best for producing code for larger vectors. However, except for
the biggest vector size, the difference is not really significantly. Apparently,
there is a regression in zapcc (or clang-5.0) since it's slower than clang-4.0
at the same level as clang-3.9.

y = alpha * x + y (axpy)
------------------------

The third benchmark is the well-known axpy (y = alpha * x + y). This is entirely
resolved by expressions templates in the library, no specific algorithm is used.
Let's see the results:

+---------------+--------+--------+-------+--------+--------+---------+
| saxpy         | 10     | 100    | 1000  | 10000  | 100000 | 1000000 |

+---------------+--------+--------+-------+--------+--------+---------+
| g++-5.4.0     | 35.0ns | 58.1ns | 383ns | 3.87us | 43.2us | 479us   |
+---------------+--------+--------+-------+--------+--------+---------+
| g++-6.3.0     | 34.3ns | 59.4ns | 371ns | 3.57us | 40.4us | 452us   |
+---------------+--------+--------+-------+--------+--------+---------+
| g++-7.1.0     | 34.8ns | 59.7ns | 399ns | 3.78us | 43.1us | 547us   |
+---------------+--------+--------+-------+--------+--------+---------+
| clang++-3.9.1 | 32.3ns | 53.8ns | 297ns | 3.21us | 38.3us | 466us   |
+---------------+--------+--------+-------+--------+--------+---------+
| clang++-4.0.1 | 32.4ns | 59.8ns | 296ns | 3.31us | 38.2us | 475us   |
+---------------+--------+--------+-------+--------+--------+---------+
| zapcc++-1.0   | 32.0ns | 54.0ns | 333ns | 3.32us | 38.7us | 447us   |
+---------------+--------+--------+-------+--------+--------+---------+

Even on the biggest vector, this is a very fast operation, once vectorized and
parallelized. At this speed, some of the differences observed may not be highly
significant. Again clang-based versions are the fastest versions on this code,
but by a small margin.  There also seems to be a slight regression in gcc-7.1,
but again quite small.

Matrix Matrix multiplication (GEMM)
-----------------------------------

The next benchmark is testing the performance of a Matrix-Matrix Multiplication,
an operation known as GEMM in the BLAS nomenclature. In that case, we test both
the naive and the optimized vectorized implementation. To save some horizontal
space, I've split the tables in two.

This time, the differences between the different compilers are very significant.
The clang compilers are leading the way by a large margin here, with clang-4.0
being the fastest of them (by another nice margin). Indeed, clang-4.0.1 is
producing code that is, on average, about twice faster than the code generated
by the best GCC compiler. Very interestingly as well, we can see a huge
regression starting from GCC-5.4 and that is still here in GCC-7.1. Indeed, the
best GCC version, in the tested versions, is again GCC-4.9.4. Clang is really
doing an excellent job of compiling the GEMM code.

As for the optimized version, it seems that the two families are reversed.
Indeed, GCC is doing a better job than clang here, and although the margin is
not as big as before, it's still significant. We can still observe a small
regression in GCC versions because the 4.9 version is again the fastest. As for
clang versions, it seems that clang-5.0 (used in zapcc) has had some performance
improvements for this case.

For this case of matrix-matrix multiplication, it's very impressive that the
differences in the non-optimized code are so significant. And it's also
impressive that each family of compilers has its own strength, clang being
seemingly much better at handling unoptimized code while GCC is better at
handling vectorized code.

Convolution (2D)
----------------

The last benchmark that I considered is the case of the valid convolution on 2D
images. The code is quite similar to the GEMM code but more complicated to
optimized due to cache locality.

In that case, we can observe the same as for the GEMM. The clang-based versions
are much producing significantly faster code than the GCC versions. Moreover, we
can also observe the same large regression starting from GCC-5.4.

This time, clang manages to produce excellent results. Indeed, all the produced
executables are significantly faster than the versions produced by GCC, except
for GCC-7.1 which is producing similar results. The other versions of GCC are
falling behind it seems. It seems that it was only for the GEMM that clang was
having a lot of troubles handling the optimized code.

Conclusion
++++++++++

Clang seems to have recently done a lot of optimizations regarding compilation
time. Indeed, clang-4.0.1 is much faster for compilation than clang-3.9.
Although GCC-7.1 is faster than GCC-6.3, all the GCC versions are slower than
GCC-4.9.4 which is the fastest at compiling code with optimizations. GCC-7.1 is
the fastest GCC version for compiling code in debug mode.

In some cases, there is almost no difference between different compilers in the
generated code. However, in more  complex algorithms such as the matrix-matrix
multiplication or the two-dimensional convolution, the differences can be quite
significant. In my tests, Clang have shown to be much better at compiling
unoptimized code. However, and especially in the GEMM case, it seems to be worse
than GCC at handling hand-optimized. I will investigate that case and try to
tailor the code so that clang is having a better time with it.

For me, it's really weird that the GCC regression, apparently starting from
GCC-5.4, has still not been fixed in GCC 7.1. I was thinking of dropping support
for GCC-4.9 in order to go full C++14 support, but now I may have to reconsider
my position. However, seeing that GCC is generally the best at handling
optimized code (especially for GEMM), I may be able to do the transition, since
the optimized code will be used in most cases.

As for zapcc, although it is still the fastest compiler in debug mode, with the
new speed of clang-4.0.1, its margin is quite small. Moreover, on optimized
build, it's not as fast as GCC. If you use clang and can have access to zapcc,
it's still quite a good option to save some time.

Overall, I have been quite pleased by clang-4.0.1 and GCC-7.1, the most recent
versions I have been testing. It seems that they did quite some good work.
I will definitely run some more tests with them and try to adapt the code. I'm
still considering whether I will drop support for some older compilers.

I hope this comparison was interesting :) My next post will probably be about
the difference in performance between my machine learning framework and other
frameworks to train neural networks.
