<p>One week ago, zapcc 1.0 was released and I've observed it to be much faster than the other
compilers in terms of compile time. This can be seen when
<a class="reference external" href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/03/release-zapcc-10-fast-cpp-compiler.html">I tested it on my Expression Templates Library (ETL)</a>. It was almost four
times faster than clang 3.9 and about 2.5 times faster than GCC.</p>
<p>The ETL library is quite heavy to compile, but still reasonable. This is not the
case for my Deep Learning Library (DLL) where compiling all the test cases takes
a very long time. I have to admit that I have been going overboard with
templates and such and I have now to pay the price. In practice, for the users
of the library, this is not a big problem since only one or two neural networks
will be compiled (and it will take hours to train), but in the test cases, there
are hundreds of them and this is a huge pain. Anyway, enough with the ramble,
I figured it would be very good to test zapcc on it and see what I can gain from
using it.</p>
<p>In this article, when I speak of a compiler thread, I mean an instance of the
processor, so it's really a process in the Linux world.</p>
<div class="section" id="results">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>However, I soon realized that I would have more issues than I thought. The first
problem is the memory consumed by zapcc. Indeed, it is based on clang and
I always had problem with huge memory consumption from clang on this library and
zapcc has even bigger memory consumption because some information is cached
between runs. The amount of memory that zapcc is able to cache can be configured
in the configuration file. By default, it can use 1.5Go of memory. When zapcc
goes over the memory limit, it simply wipes out its caches. This means that all
the gain for the next compilation will be lost, since the cache will have to be
rebuilt from scratch. This is not a hard limit for the compilation itself.
Indeed, if the compilation itself takes 3Go, it will still be able to complete
it, but it is likely that the cache will be wiped after the compilation.</p>
<p>When I tried compiling using several threads, it soon used all my memory and
crashed. The same occurs with clang but I can still compile with 3 or 4 threads
without too much issues on this computer. The same also occurs with GCC but it
can still handle 4 or 5 threads (depending on the order of the compilation
units).</p>
<p>The tests are performed on my desktop computer at work, which is not really
good... I have 12Go of RAM (I had to ask for extra...) and an old Sandy Bridge
processor, but at least I have an SSD (also had to ask for extra).</p>
<p>I started with testing with only one compiler thread. For zapcc, I set the
maximum memory limit to 8Go. Even with such a limit, the zapcc server restarted
more than 10 times during the compilation of the 84 test cases. After this first
experiment, I increased the number of threads to 2 for each compiler, using 4Go
limit for zapcc. The limit is for each server and each parallel thread will
spawn a new server, so the effective limit is the number of threads times the
limit. Even with two threads, I was unable to finish a compilation with zapcc.
This is quite disappoint for me since clang is able to run with 4 threads in
parallel. Moreover, a big problem with that is that the servers are not always
killed when there is no no more memory, they just hang and use all the memory of
the computer, which is evidently really inconvenient for service processes. When
this happens with clang or gcc, the compiler simply crashes and the memory is
released and make is interrupted. Since zapcc is not able to work with more than
one thread on this computer, the results are the ones with one thread. I was
also surprised to be able to compile the library with clang and four threads,
this was not possible before clang-3.9.</p>

<p>If we look at the results with only one thread, we can see that there still are
some significant improvements when using zapcc, but nowhere near as good as what
was seen in the compilation of ETL. Here, the compilation time is reduced by 34%
compared to gcc and by 27% compared to clang. This is not bad, since it is
faster than the other compilers, but I would have expected better speedups. We
can see that g++-4.9 is slightly faster than g++-5.3, but this is not really
a significant difference. I'm actually very surprised to find that clang is
faster than g++ on this experiment. On ETL, it is always very significantly
slower and before, it was also significantly slower on DLL. I was so used to
this, that I stopped using it on this project. I may have to reconsider my
position when working on this project.</p>
<p>Let's look at the results with more than two threads. Even with two threads,
every compiler is faster than zapcc. Indeed, zapcc is slower than Clang by 25%
and slower than GCC by about 15%. If we use more threads, the other compilers
are becoming even faster and the slowdowns of zapcc are more important. When
using four threads, zapcc is about 48% slower than gcc and about 50% slower than
clang. This is really showing one big downside of zapcc that has a very large
memory consumption. When it is used to compile really heavy template code, it is
failing very early to use more processes. And even when there is enough memory,
the speedups are not as great as for relatively simpler code.</p>
<p>One may argue that this is not a fair comparison since zapcc does not have the
same numbers of threads. However, considering that this is the best zapcc can do
on this machine, I would argue that this is a fair comparison in this limited
experimental setting. If we were to have a big machine for compilation, which
I don't have at work, the zapcc results would likely be more interesting, but in
this specific limited case, it shows that zapcc suffers from its high memory
consumption. It should also be taken into account that this experiment was done
with almost nothing else running on the machine (no browser for instance) to
have as much memory as possible available for the compilers. This is not
a common use case.  Most of the days, when I compile something, I have my
browser open, which makes a large difference in memory available, and several
other applications (but consoles and vim instances do not really consume memory
:D).</p>
<p>This experiment made me realize that the compilation times for this library were
quickly becoming crazy. Most of the time, the complete test suite is only
compiled on my Continuous Integration machine at home which has a much faster
processor and much more RAM. Therefore, it is relatively fast since it uses more
threads to compile.  Nevertheless, this is not a good point that the unit tests
takes so much time to compile. I plan to split the test cases in several sets.
Because, currently the real unit tests are compiled with the performance tests
and other various tests. I'll probably end up generating three executables. This
will help greatly during development. Moreover, I also have a technique to
decrease the compilation time by erasing some template parameters at compilation
time. This is already ready, but has currently a runtime overhead that I will
try to remove and then use this technique everywhere to get back to reasonable
compilation times. I'll also try to see if I can find obvious compilation
bottlenecks in the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude, while zapcc brings some very interesting compilation speedups in
some cases like in my ETL library, it also has some downsides, namely
<strong>huge memory consumption</strong>. This memory consumption may prevent the use of several
compiler threads and render zapcc much less interesting than other compilers.</p>
<p>When trying to compile my DLL library on a machine with 12Go of RAM with two
zapcc threads, it was impossible for me to make it complete. While zapcc was
faster with one thread than the other compilers, they were able to use up to
four threads and in the end <strong>zapcc was about twice slower than clang</strong>.</p>
<p>I knew that zapcc memory consumption was very large, but I would have not have
expected something so critical. Another feature that would be interesting in
zapcc would be to set a max memory hard limit for the server instead of simply
a limit on the cache they are able to keep in memory. This would prevent hanging
the complete computer when something goes wrong.</p>
<p>I had a good surprise with clang that was actually faster than GCC and also able
to work with four threads in parallel. This was not the case with previous
version of clang. On ETL, it is still significantly slower than GCC though.</p>
<p>For now, I'll continue using clang on this DLL project and use zapcc only on my
ETL project. I'll also focus on improving the compilation time on this project
and make it reasonable again.</p>
