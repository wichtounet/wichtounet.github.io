I'm happy to announce that I've successfully defended my thesis "Deep Learning
Features for Image Processing". After four years, I've defended it officially in
front of the thesis committed last Friday and then again two days ago I've
successfully publicly defended in front of my friends, family and colleagues.

I'm now a "Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science :)

I will update my thesis with the last comments in November and send the final
version to the university. At which point, I'll publish it on this website as
well.
