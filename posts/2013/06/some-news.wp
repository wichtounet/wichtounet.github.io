No, I'm not dead ;)

After having finished my Master thesis in March, I took a break from my personal projects including this project. I then started a job in my school, waiting for a Ph.D thesis. I'm now working on a very interesting Machine Learning project about Speech, unfortunately in Java ;)

I just started again working on eddic this week. I'm gonna try to improve as much as possible the performances of the parser. I will also try to post again some articles on this blog, although I don't know about what.
