Software Reliability
====================

In behalf of my school (College of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg), I
presented a shoft presentation about Software Reliability. In this presentation,
I outline the main issues about the subject and propose some solutions: 

* Software Validation
* Defensive Programming
* Software Analysis Tools

In the Software Analysis Tools, I present three tools: cppcheck, Valgrind and
the Clang Static analyzer. Several examples are presented for each tools as well
as some recommendations for using them. A short presentation of SonarQube is
also performed. 

I thought that it could be of some interest to some of the readers, so here it
is:

Don't hesitate if you have any comments or questions about the presentation ;)

The source code for the examples is available `on Github
