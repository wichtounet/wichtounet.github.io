At my school, I gave a short presentation about Deep Learning and the
implementation I made in C++. 

It is nothing fancy, but it could be interesting to someone.

    <div style="text-align:center;"><iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/39024941" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>

Don't hesitate if you have any comments or questions about the presentation ;)

The implementation is here: https://github.com/wichtounet/dll
