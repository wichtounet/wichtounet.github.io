I've finally taken the time to upgrade the website to Nikola 7 (it is about time, I know...).

The migration worked flawlessly, I simply had to update configuration to migrate deprecated and renamed tags and it worked really well. I also had to add a comma to the COMPILERS list because of the use of Python 3.3 now.

As you may have seen, I haven't posted in a while. I had quite some work for my thesis as well as for the courses I give at my school and I started playing Path Of Exile with took quite a bit of my free time :) I'll try to give some updates on the project I'm working on to make this blog live again.
