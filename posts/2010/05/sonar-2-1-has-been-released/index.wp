The version 2.1 of Sonar has just been released. This version includes 51 bugfixes and improvements. The major new features are :

<ul>
	<li>A new page "Librairies" displays all the librairies of the project (Maven dependencies)</li>
	<li>A new page "Dependencies" searches for library usages</li>
	<li>A new page "System Info" display the system properties, installed plugins, database and VM memory stats.</li>
	<li>New rules to detect unused methods.</li>
</ul>

Normally, all the plugins compatible with version 2.0 should be compatible with this new version.
