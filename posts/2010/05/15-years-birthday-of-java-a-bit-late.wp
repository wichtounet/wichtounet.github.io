I didn't notice that earlier, but the 23 May 2010 was the 15 years birthday of Java !

I started using Java only 5 years ago, but I've always been happy of this language. 

It makes now a long time that we've this wonderful language to develop :)

Thanks a lot to James Gosling and Sun Microsystems for this great language.
