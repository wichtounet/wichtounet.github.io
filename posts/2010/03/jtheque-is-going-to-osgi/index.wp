Just a little post to inform you that i'm currently migrating JTheque Core to OSGI / Spring Dynamic Modules. The core will be fractioned into several bundles. The JTheque Modules will also be OSGi bundles.

It will increase the modularity of the different services of the Core. And it will also be a more standard way to develop modules. And last but not least, it's an opportunity for me to learn OSGi and Spring Dm.
