A very simple tip that can save a lot of time. 

When i wanted to do a git clone, I had the given error : 

<pre>Agent admitted failure to sign using the key.
Permission denied (publickey).</pre>

I found that this is an SSH error. 

One of the readers, Leonardo Hessel, pointed that out that ssh-add is also a solution: 

<pre>ssh-add</pre>

Another solution is simply to login and logout and it should work.
