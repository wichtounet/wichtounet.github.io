Some informations about the current state of JTheque. I'm currently migrating it from SVN to Git. Actually the projet is hosted at Developpez.com, a french community. For more visibility, i wanted to host it in an english website. After several days of comparative, I chosen Github has host. Because i chose Git, i think it's the best and easier community to share projects using Git.

I will use a subdomain in this website (jtheque.baptiste-wicht.com) to host the Javadoc and maven reports, because it take too space to store it at GitHub. I will use GitHub for the sources, issues and Wiki.

After only several days of work with Git, I found it really fun and comfortable to work with.

Here are the already created projects on GitHub :

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/wichtounet/jtheque-utils" target="_blank">jtheque-utils</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/wichtounet/jtheque-unit-utils" target="_blank">jtheque-unit-utils</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/wichtounet/jtheque-xml-utils" target="_blank">jtheque-xml-utils</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/wichtounet/jtheque-core" target="_blank">jtheque-core</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/wichtounet/jtheque-primary-utils" target="_blank">jtheque-primary-utils</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/wichtounet/jtheque-movies-module" target="_blank">jtheque-movies-module</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/wichtounet/jtheque-memory-module" target="_blank">jtheque-memory-module</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/wichtounet/jtheque-osgi-wrap" target="_blank">jtheque-osgi-wrap</a></li>
</ul>

Most of them are not completed at all. But the start is here. Don't hesitate to comment on how I did that. I've also already created a site for jtheque-xml-utils (<a href="http://jtheque.baptiste-wicht.com/xml-utils/">http://jtheque.baptiste-wicht.com/xml-utils/</a>).

I will migrate all the projects into Git and complete the GitHub repositories and Maven Site the next few weeks.

If I didn't post a lot these last weeks, it's because, it's the end of the semester, so it seems a lot of exams and projects to finish, so not a lot of time to post. I will do better the next month.
