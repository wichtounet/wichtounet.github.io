Five years after Java 6, Oracle has just released Java 7!

This is the first release of Java since Oracle bought Sun Microsystems.

This new version of Java introduces a lot of new features, but some of the languages new features will be introduced in Java 8 <a title="Java 7 delays and Plan B" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/09/java-7-delays-and-plan-b/">as stated by the "Plan B"</a>.

In this version, there some great new language features, as stated by the JSR 334 :

<ul>
	<li>Strings in switch</li>
	<li>Binary integral literals and underscores in numeric literals</li>
	<li><a title="Better exception handling in Java 7 : Multicatch and precise rethrow" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/05/better-exception-handling-in-java-7-multicatch-and-final-rethrow/">Multi-catch and more precise rethrow</a></li>

</ul>

A new bytecode instruction has been added to the virtual machine, <a title="Java 7 : More dynamics" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/04/java-7-more-dynamics/">InvokeDynamic</a>.

You can <a title="Download Java 7 on Oracle website" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">download Java SE 7</a> on the Oracle website.

I think it was time now for Java to have a new version with some refreshing, and it's IMO a good new version that we have now. I just hope that the next version,  Java 8, will be here in less than five years to <a title="Oracle pushes a first version of the closures" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/05/oracle-pushes-a-first-version-of-closures/">give us the closures</a>.
