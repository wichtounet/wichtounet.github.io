After a long time with the old F2 theme, I decided to choose a more modern design. I chose the WP Plus design which is based on the Google Plus Design. 

I think that this design is more practical and cleaner for the users and more comfortable. 

Moreover, I also took some time to change some of my addons. I replaced All In One SEO with Wordpress SEO plugin from Joost de Valk. I think that this plugin is better than the first one, but more of that, it also replaced one addon generating the XML sitemap and helped me adding a breadcrumb to the site. 

I hope that these changes will improve the user experience on my website. 

If you encounter any kind of problems with the new design, don't hesitate to let a comment or to contact me.
