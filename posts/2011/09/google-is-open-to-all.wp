After about 90 days of trial on invitation-only mode, <a href="http://plus.google.com" title="Google+">Google+</a> is now open to everybody. 

For those who don't know, Google+ is the social network platform of Google, with several interesting features like Circles, Hangouts, ...

For example, you can <a href="https://plus.google.com/103113673902796202116/" title="My Page on Google+">see my page on Google+</a>. 

Personally, I find this social network very interesting, but there are not enough people on it to concurrence really Facebook and the others networks. Don't hesitate to give it a try, it's worth it!
