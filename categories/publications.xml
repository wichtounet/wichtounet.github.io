interest you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307908790_On_CPU_Performance_Optimization_of_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine_and_Convolutional_RBM"&gt;On CPU Performance Optimizations for Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Convolutional RBM&lt;/a&gt;, published in the Proceedings of the Artificial Neural Networks and Pattern Recognition workshop (ANNPR-2016). I've presented this paper in Germany, at Ulm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most of the performance research going on is focused on GPU, there are
still of research laboratories that are only equipped with CPU and it remains
important to be as fast as possible on CPU. Moreover, this is something
I really like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this publication, I have tried to make my Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
and Convolutional RBM (CRBM) implementations in my DLL library as fast as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the article is about Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) which
are a form of dense Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Their training is very
similar to that of the ANN with Gradient Descent. Four different network
configurations are being tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, mini-batch training is shown to be much faster than online training, even
when online training is performed in parallel. Once mini-batch training is used,
BLAS operations are used in order to get as much performance as possible on the
different operations, mainly the Matrix Matrix Multiplication with the use of
the GEMM operation from the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL). Moreover, the
parallel version of the MKL is also used to get even more performance. When all
these optimizations are performed, speedups of 11 to 30 are obtained compared to
the online training, depending on the network configurations. This final version
is able  to perform one epoch of Contrastive Divergence in 4 to 15 seconds
depending on the network, for 60000 images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the article is about Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann
Machine (CRBM). This is almost the equivalent of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). Again four different networks are evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem with CRBM is that there are no standard implementations of the
convolution operation that is really fast. Therefore, it is not possible to
simply use a BLAS library to make the computation as fast as possible. The first
optimization that was tried is to vectorize the convolutions. With this, the
speedups have been between 1.1 and 1.9 times faster. I'm not really satisfied
with these results since in fact per convolution the speedups are much better.
Moreover, I have since been able to obtain better speedups but the deadline was
too short to include them in this paper. I'll try to talk about these
improvements in more details on this blog. What is more interesting to to
parallellize the different convolutions since they are mostly independent. This
can bring a speedup of the amount of cores available on the machine. Since
convolutions are extremely memory hungry, virtual cores with Hyper Threading
generally does not help. An interesting optimization is to use a Matrix
Multiplication to compute several valid convolutions at once.  This can give an
additional speedup between 1.6 and 2.2 compared to the vectorized version. While
it is possible to use the FFT to reduce the full convolution as well, in our
experiment the images were not big enough for this to be interesting. The final
speedups are about 10 times faster with these optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have obtained pretty good and I'm happy we have been published. However, I'm
not very satisfied with these results since I've been able to get even faster
since this and when compared with other frameworks, DLL is actually quite
competitive. I'll try to publish something new in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more information, you can have a look at the paper. If you want to
look at the code, you can have a look at my projects:&lt;/p&gt;

I thought it was time to start. I'll start to write a few posts about my earlier
publications and then I'll try to write something for the new ones not too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the story, I'm currently a PHD student at the University of Fribourg, in
Switzerland. My PHD is about the use of Deep Learning technologies to
automatically extract features from images. I have developed my Deep Learning
Library (DLL) project for this thesis. We have published a few articles on the
various projects that we tackled during the thesis. I'll try to go in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the thesis, I used Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Deep
Belief Network to perform digit recognition on images of Sudoku taken with
a phone camera. We published two papers on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282303748_Camera-based_Sudoku_recognition_with_deep_belief_network"&gt;Camera-based Sudoku Recognition with Deep Belief Network&lt;/a&gt;, in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition (SOCPAR-2014)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307545305_Mixed_handwritten_and_printed_digit_recognition_in_Sudoku_with_Convolutional_Deep_Belief_Network"&gt;Mixed Handwritten and printed digit recognition in Sudoku With Convolutional Deep Belief Network&lt;/a&gt;, in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR-2015)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sudoku grid and digits are detected using standard image processing
techniques:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The image is first converted to grayscale, then a median blur is applied to
remove noise and the image is binarized using Adapteive Thresholding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The edges are detected using the Canny algorithm. From these, the lines are
detected using a Progressive Probabilistic Hough Transform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a connected component analysis, the segments of lines are clustered
together to detect the Sudoku Grid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cells are then detected inside the grid using the inner lines and contour
detection is used to isolate the digits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one of the original images from our dataset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Original image from our dataset" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/image124.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the detected characters from the previous image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Detected digits from our application" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/image124_char.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all the digits have been found they are passed to a Deep Belief Network for
recognition. A Deep Belief Network is composed of several Restricted Boltzmann
Machines (RBM) that are stacked. The network is pretrained, by training each
RBM, in turn, with Contrastive Divergence. This algorithm basically trains each
RBM as an auto-encoder and learns a good feature representation of the inputs.
Once all the layers have been trained, the network can then be trained as
a regular neural network with Stochastic Gradient Descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second paper, the images of Sudoku are containing both computer printed
and handwritten digits (the grid is already filled). The other difference is
that the second system used a Convolutional DBN instead of DBN. The difference
being that each layer is a Convolutional RBM. Such a model will learn a set of
small filters that will be applied to each position of the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the second version of the dataset, we have been able to achieve 99.14% of
recognition of the digits or 92.5% of fully-recognized grid  with the
Convolutional Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/sudoku_recognizer"&gt;C++ implementation on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a look, I've updated the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/stories/publications.html"&gt;list of my publications&lt;/a&gt;
on this website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more details on this project, don't hesitate to ask here or on
Github, or read the paper :)
The next post about my publications will probably be about CPU performances!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>deep learning</category><category>dll</category><category>Personal</category><category>publications</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/01/publications-sudoku-recognition-with-deep-belief-network.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2017 07:56:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Update: Thor, Thesis and Publications</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2016/08/update-thor-thesis-and-publications.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it's been a real while since the last post I've written here, I wanted to
write a short status update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to serve one month in the army, which does not help at all for
productivity :P Since the update to Boost Spirit X3, I haven't worked on my
eddic compiler again, but I've switched back to my operating system project:
thor. I'm having a lot of fun with it again and it's in much better state than
before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have been very productive on the publication side, with four new
publications this year in various conferences. I'll update the blog when the
proceedings are published. I'll be going to ICANN 2016 and ANNPR 2016 next week
and probably to ICFHR in October. And of course, I'll go back to Meeting C++ in
November :) As for my thesis, it's finally going great, I've started writing
regularly and it's taking form!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="thor"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project Thor Operating System now has much more features than before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;64bit operating system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preemptive Multiprocessing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyboard / Mouse driver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full ACPI support with ACPICA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read/Write ATA driver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FAT32 file system support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HPET/RTC/PIT drivers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic PCI support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi stage booting with FAT32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since last time, I've fixed tons of bug in the system. Although there are still
some culprit, it's much more stable than before. They were a lot of bugs in the
scheduler with loads of race conditions. I hope I've working through most of
them now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently working on the network stack. I'm able to receive and send packets
using the Realtek 8139 card. I have working support for Ethernet, IP and ARP.
I'm currently working on adding ICMP support. I've come to realize that the
hardest part is not to develop the code here but to find a way to test it.
Network in Qemu is a huge pain in the ass to configure. And then, you need tools
to generate some packets or at least answer to packets send by the virtual
machine, and it's really bad... Nevertheless, it's pretty fun overall :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from this, I'm also working on a window manager. I'll try to post an
update on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can take a look at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/thor-os"&gt;thor sources&lt;/a&gt; if you're interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="future"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time being, I'll focus my effort on the thor project. I also have some
development to do on my home automation system: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/asgard-server"&gt;asgard-server&lt;/a&gt; that I plan to finalize and deploy in a useful way this weekend in my apartment. You can also expect some updates on my deep learning library where I've started work to make it more user-friendly (kind of). I'm also still waiting on the first stable version of doctest for a new comparison with Catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really want to try to publish again some more posts on the blog. I'll
especially try to publish some more updates about Thor.&lt;/p&gt;
