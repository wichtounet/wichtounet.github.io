&lt;p&gt;It took me longer than I thought, but I'm glad to announce the release of the
version 1.1 of my Expression Templates Library (ETL) project. This is a major
new release with many improvements and new features. It's been almost one month
since the last, and first, release (1.0) was released. I should have done some
minor releases in the mean time, but at least now the library is in a good shape
for major version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be interesting to note that my machine learning framework (DLL), based on
the ETL library, has shown to be faster than all the tested popular frameworks
(Tensorflow, Keras, Caffee, Torch, DeepLearning4J) for training various neural
networks on CPU. I'll post more details on another post on the coming weeks, but
that shows that special attention to performance has been done in this library
and that it is well adapted to machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you that don't follow my blog, ETL is a library providing
Expression Templates for computations on matrix and vector. For instance, if you
have three matrices A, B and C you could write C++ code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code cpp"&gt;&lt;a name="rest_code_daa245034ff44bc1996e8669bf789c8f-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or given vectors b, v, h and a matrix W, you could write code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code cpp"&gt;&lt;a name="rest_code_3c3eebe723424668a4a3de3ffb719fca-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sigmoid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of such library is two-fold. First, this makes the expression more
readable and as close to math as possible. And then, it allows the library to
compute the expressions as fast as possible.  In the first case, the framework
will compute the sum using a vectorized algorithm and then compute the overall
expression using yet again vectorized code. The expression can also be computed
in parallel if the matrices are big enough. In the second case, the
vector-matrix multiplication will be computed first using either hand-code
optimized vectorized or a BLAS routine (depending on configuration options).
Then, all the expression will be executed using vectorized code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="features"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many new features have been integrated into the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The support for machine learning operations has been improved. There are now
specific helpers for machine learning in the etl::ml namespace which have names
that are standard to machine learning. A real transposed convolution has been
implemented with support for padding and stride. Batched outer product and
batched bias averaging are also now supported. The activation function support
has also been improved and the derivatives have been reviewed. The pooling
operators have also been improved with stride and padding support. Unrelated to
machine learning, 2D and 3D pooling can also be done in higher dimensional
matrix now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New functions are also available for matrices and vectors. The support for
square root has been improved with cubic root and inverse root. Support has also
been added for floor and ceil. Moreover, comparison operators are now available
as well as global functions such as approx_equals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New reductions have also been added with support for absolute sum and mean
(asum/asum) and for min_index and max_index, which returns the index of the
minimum element, respectively the maximum. Finally, argmax can now be used to
get the max index in each sub dimensions of a matrix. argmax on a vector is
equivalent to max_index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for shuffling has also been added. By default, shuffling a vector means
shuffling all elements and shuffling a matrix means shuffling by shuffling the
sub matrices (only the first dimension is shuffled), but shuffling a matrix as
a vector is also possible. Shuffle of two vectors or two matrices in parallel,
is also possible. In that case, the same permutation is applied to both
containers. As a side note, all operations using random generation are also
available with an addition parameter for the random generator, which can help to
improve reproducibility or simply tune the random generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also included support for adapters matrices. There are adapters for
hermitian matrices, symmetric matrices and lower and upper triangular matrices.
For now, the framework does not take advantage of this information, this will be
done later, but the framework guarantee the different constrain on the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also a few new more minor features. Maybe not so minor, matrices can
now be sliced into sub matrices. With that a matrix can be divided into several
sub matrices and modifying the sub matrices will modify the source matrix. The
sub matrices are available in 2D, 3D and 4D for now. There are also some other
ways of slicing matrix and vectors. It is possible to obtain a slice of its
memory or obtain a slice of its first dimension. Another new feature is that it
is now possible compute the cross product of vectors now. Matrices can be
decomposed into their Q/R decomposition rather than only their PALU
decomposition. Special support has been integrated for matrix and vectors of
booleans. In that case, they support logical operators such as and, not and or.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="performance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always considered the performance of this library to be a feature itself.
I consider the library to be quite fast, especially its convolution support,
even though there is still room for improvement. Therefore, many improvements
have been made to the performance of the library since the last release. As said
before, this library was used in a machine learning framework which then proved
faster than most popular neural network frameworks on CPU. I'll present here
the most important new improvements to performance, in no real particular order,
every bit being important in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, several operations have been optimized to be faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiplication of matrices or matrices and vectors are now much faster if one of
the matrix is transposed. Instead of performing the slow transposition,
different kernels are used in order to maximize performance without doing any
transposition, although sometimes transposition is performed when it is faster.
This leads to very significant improvements, up to 10 times faster in the best
case. This is performed for vectorized kernels and also for BLAS and CUBLAS
calls. These new kernels are also directly used when matrices of different
storage order are used. For instance, multiplying a column major matrix with
a row major matrix and storing the result in a column major matrix is now much
more efficient than before. Moreover, the performance of the transpose operation
itself is also much faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of machine learning operations have also been highly optimized. All the
pooling and upsample operators are now parallelized and the most used kernel
(2x2 pooling) is now more optimized. 4D convolution kernels (for machine
learning) have been greatly improved. There are now very specialized vectorized
kernels for classic kernel configurations (for instance 3x3 or 5x5) and the
selection of implementations is now smarter than before. The support of padding
is now much better than before for small amount of padding. Moreover, for small
kernels the full convolution can now be evaluated using the valid convolution
kernels directly with some padding, for much faster overall performance. The
exponential operation is now vectorized which allows operations such as sigmoid
or softmax to be much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrices and vector are automatically using aligned memory. This means that
vectorized code can use aligned operations, which may be slightly faster.
Moreover, matrices and vectors are now padded to a multiple of the vector size.
This allows to remove the final non-vectorized remainder loop from the
vectorized code. This is only done for the end of matrices, when they are
accessed in flat way. Contrary to some frameworks, inner dimensions of the
matrix are not padded.  Finally, accesses to 3D and 4D matrices is now much
faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the parallelization feature of ETL has been completely reworked. Before,
there was a thread pool for each algorithm that was parallelized. Now, there is
a global thread engine with one thread pool. Since parallelization is not nested
in ETL, this improves performance slightly by greatly diminishing the number of
threads that are created throughout an application. Another big difference in
parallel dispatching is that now it can detect good split based on alignment so
that each split are aligned. This then allows the vectorization process to use
aligned stores and loads instead of unaligned ones which may be faster on some
processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vectorization has also been greatly improved in ETL. Integer operations are now
automatically vectorized on processors that support this. Before, only floating
points operations were vectorized. The automatic vectorizer now is able to use
non-temporal stores for very large operations. A non-temporal store bypasses the
cache, thus gaining some time. Since very large matrices do not fit in cache
anyway and the cache would end up being overwritten anyway, this is a net gain.
Moreover, the alignment detection in the automatic vectorizer has also been
improved. Support for Fused-Multiply-Add (FMA) operations has also been
integrated in the algorithms that can make use of it (multiplications and
convolutions). The matrix-matrix multiplications and vector-matrix
multiplications now have highly optimized vectorized kernels. They also have
versions for column-major matrices now.  I plan to reintegrate a version of the
GEMM based on BLIS in the future but with more optimizations and support for all
precisions and integers, For my version is still slower than the simple
vectorized version. The sum and the dot product operations now also have
specialized vectorized implementations. The min and max operations are now
automatically-vectorized. Several others algorithms have also their own
vectorized implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, the GPU support has also been almost completely reworked.
Now, several operations can be chained without any copies between GPU and CPU.
Several new operations have also been added with support to GPU (convolutions,
pooling, sigmoid, ReLU, ...). Moreover, to complement operations that are not
available in any of the supported NVIDIA libraries, I've created a simple
library that can be used to add a few more GPU operations.  Nevertheless a lot
of operations are still missing and only algorithms are available not
expressions (such as c = a + b * 1.0) that are entirely computed on CPU. I have
plans to improve that further, probably for version 1.2. The different contexts
necessary for NVIDIA library can now be cached (using an option from ETL),
leading to much faster code. Only the main handle can be cached so far, I plan
to try to cache all the descriptors, but I don't know yet when that will be
ready. Finally, an option is also available to reuse GPU memory instead of
directly releasing it to CUDA. This is using a custom memory pool and can save
some time. Since this needs to be cleaned (by a call to etl::exit() or using
ETL_PROLOGUE), this is only activated on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-changes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also have been a lot of refactorings in the code of the library. A lot of
expressions now have less overhead and are specialized for performance.
Moreover, temporary expressions have been totally reworked to be more simple and
maintainable and easier to optimize in the future. It's also probably easier to
add new expressions to the framework now, although that could be even more
simple. There are also less duplicated code now in the different expressions.
Especially, now there are now more SSE and AVX variants in the code. All the
optimized algorithms are now using the vectorization system of the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried my best to reduce the compilation time, based on the unit tests.
This is still not great but better than before. For user code, the next version
should be much faster to compile since I plan to disable forced selection of
implementations by default and only enable it on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there also was quite a few bug fixes. Most of them have been found by
the use of the library in the Deep Learning Library (DLL) project. Some were
very small edge cases. For instance, the transposition algorithm was not working
on GPU on rectangular column major matrices. There also was a slight bug in the
Q/R decomposition and in the pooling of 4D matrices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time, I may do some minor release, but I don't yet have a complete plan.
For the next major release (1.2 probably), here is what is planned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the system for selection of algorithms to reduce compilation time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the GPU system to allow more complete support for standard operators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch to C++17: there are many improvements that could be done to the code with C++17 features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add support for convolution on mixed types (float/double)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More tests for sparse matrix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More algorithms support for sparse matrix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the compilation time of the library in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the compilation and execution time of the unit tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are pretty big changes, especially the first two, so maybe it'll be split
into several releases. It will really depend on the time I have. As for C++17,
I really want to try it and I have a lot of points that could profit from the
switch, but that will means setting GCC 7.1 and Clang 3.9 as minimum
requirement, which may not be reasonable for every user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="download-etl"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download ETL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download ETL &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl"&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt;. If you
only interested in the 1.1 version, you can look at the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl/releases"&gt;Releases pages&lt;/a&gt; or clone the tag
1.1. There are several branches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; Is the eternal development branch, may not always be stable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt; Is a branch always pointing to the last tag, no development here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the future release, there always will tags pointing to the corresponding
commits. I'm not following the git flow way, I'd rather try to have a more
linear history with one eternal development branch, rather than an useless
develop branch or a load of other branches for releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation is a bit sparse. There are a few examples and the Wiki, but
there still is work to be done. If you have questions on how to use or configure
the library, please don't hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't hesitate to comment this post if you have any comment on this library or
any question. You can also open an Issue on Github if you have a problem using
this library or propose a Pull Request if you have any contribution you'd like
to make to the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this may be useful to some of you :)&lt;/p&gt;

environment and simply to use either the TensorFlow official packages in pip or
use one of the official wheels for distributions.  There is one big problem with
that technique and it's the fact that the binaries are precompiled so that they
fit as many hardware configuration as possible. This is normal from Google since
generating precompiled binaries for all the possible combinations of processor
capabilities would be a nightmare. This is not a problem for GPU
since the CUDA Libraries will take care of the difference from one graphics card
to another. But it is a problem with CPU performance. Indeed, different
processors have different capabilities. For instance, the vectorization
capabilities are different from processor to processor (SSE, AVX, AVX2,
AVX-512F, FMA, ...). All those options can make a significant difference in the
performance of the programs. Although most of the machine learning training
occurs on GPU most of the time, the inference is mostly done on the CPU.
Therefore, it probably remains important to be as fast as possible on CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you care about performance on CPU, you should install TensorFlow from
sources directly yourself. This will allow compilation of the TensorFlow sources
with -march=native which will enable all the hardware capabilities of machine on
which you are compiling the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your problem, this may give you some nice speedup. In my case, on
a very small Recurrent Neural Network, it made inference about 20% faster.  On
a larger problem and depending on your processor, you may gain much more than
that. If you are training on CPU, this may make a very large difference in total
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing TensorFlow is sometimes a bit cumbersome. You'll likely have to
compile Bazel from sources as well and depending on your processor, it may take
a long time to finish. Nevertheless, I have successfully compiled TensorFlow
from sources on several machines now without too many problems. Just pay close
attention to the options you are setting while configuring TensorFlow, for
instance CUDA configuration if you want GPU support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this little trick will help you gain some time :)&lt;/p&gt;

There is some work to do before I release the next version, but I wanted to give you a quick update on what has been going on for ETL in the last months. There has been a lot of changes in the library and the next version will be a major update when I'm done with some refactorings and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my thesis supervisor, the project now has a logo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="ETL Logo" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/logo.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few new features, although probably nothing really major. The
support for square root has been improved with cubic root and inverse root.
Vectors can now be transformed using floor and ceil. Cross product of vector has
been implemented as well. Batched outer product and batched bias averaging (for
machine learning) are now supported. Reductions have also been improved with
absolute sum and mean (asum/asum) support and min_index and max_index. argmax
can now be used to get the max index in each sub dimensions. Matrix can now be
decomposed into their Q/R decomposition rather than only their PALU
decomposition. The matrices can now be sliced by getting only a sub part of the
matrix. The pooling operators  have also been improved with stride and padding
support. Matrices and vectors can also be shuffled. Moreover, a few adapters
are now available for hermitian matrices, symmetric matrices and lower and upper
matrices. So far the support for these adapters is not huge, but they are
guaranteed to validate their constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several operations have been optimized for speed. All the pooling and upsample
operators are now parallelized and the most used kernel (2x2 pooling) is now
more optimized. 4D convolution kernels (for machine learning) have been greatly
improved. There are now very specialized vectorized kernels for classic kernel

now smarter than before. The support of padding now much better than before for
small amount of padding. Moreover, for small kernels the full convolution can
now be evaluated using the valid convolution kernels directly with some padding,
for much faster overall performance. Matrix-matrix multiplication with
transposed matrices is now much faster when using BLAS kernels. Indeed, the
transposition is not performed but handled inside the kernels. Moreover, the
performance of the transposition itself is also much faster. Finally, accesses
to 3D and 4D matrices is now much faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parallelization feature of ETL has been completely reworked. Before, there
was a thread pool for each algorithm that was parallelized. Now, there is
a global thread engine with one thread pool. Since parallelization is not nested

&lt;p&gt;Vectorization has also been greatly improved in ETL. Integer operations are now

A non-temporal store bypasses the cache, thus gaining some time. Since very

detection in the automatic vectorizer has also been improved. Support for
Fused-Multiply-Add (FMA) operations has also been integrated in the algorithms
that can make use of it. The matrix-matrix multiplications and vector-matrix
multiplications now have optimized vectorized kernels. They also have versions
for column-major matrices now. The old egblas version of the gemm, based on BLIS
kernels, has been removed since it was only supporting double-precision and was
not faster than the new vectorized algorithm. I plan to reintegrate a version of
the GEMM based on BLIS in the future but with more optimizations and support for
all precisions and integers. The sum and the dot product now also have
specialized vectorized implementations. The min and max operations are now
automatically-vectorized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GPU has also been almost completely reworked. Now, operations can be chained

expressions now have less overhead and are specialized for performance.
Moreover, temporary expressions are currently being reworked in order to be more
simple and maintainable and easier to optimize in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there also was quite a few bug fixes. Most of them have been found by
the use of the library in the Deep Learning Library (DLL) project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>C++</category><category>C++14</category><category>etl</category><category>Performance</category><category>projects</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/05/update-on-expression-templates-library-etl.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2017 19:31:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>C++ Compiler benchmark on Expression Templates Library (ETL)</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2016/12/cpp-compiler-benchmark-on-expression-templates-library-etl.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-hVVnYaiADRTO2PzUGmuLJr8BLUSjGIZsDYGmIJLv2b8=" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src="https://code.highcharts.com/modules/exporting.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my Expression Templates Library (ETL) project, I have a lot of template heavy
code that needs to run as fast as possible and that is quite intensive to
compile. In this post, I'm going to compare the performance of a few of the
kernels produced by different compilers. I've got GCC 5.4, GCC 6.20 and clang
3.9. I also included zapcc which is based on clang 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tests have been run on an Haswell processor. The automatic parallelization
of ETL has been turned off for these tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that some of the diagrams are presented in logarithmic form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="vector-multiplication"&gt;

});
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;For small vectors, clang is significantly slower than gcc-5.4 and gcc6.2. On
vectors from 100'000 elements, the speed is comparable for each compiler,
depending on the memory bandwidth. Overall, gcc-6.2 produces the fastest code
here. clang-4.0 is slightly slower than clang-3.9, but nothing dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="vector-exponentiation"&gt;

});
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this time, clang versions are significantly faster for medium to
large vectors, from 1000 elements and higher, by about 5%. There is no
significant differences between the different versions of each compiler.&lt;/p&gt;

});
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are few differences between the compilers. The first thing is that for
some sizes such as 80x80 and 100x100, clang is significantly faster than GCC, by
more than 10%. The other interesting fact is that for large matrices
zapcc-clang-4.0 is always slower than clang-3.9 which is itself on par with the
two GCC versions. In my opinion, it comes from a regression in clang trunk but
it could also come from zapcc itself.&lt;/p&gt;

});
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are much more interesting here! First, there is a huge regression in
clang-4.0 (or in zapcc for that matter). Indeed, it is up to 6 times slower than
clang-3.9. Moreover, the clang-3.9 is always significantly faster than gcc-6.2.
Finally, there is a small improvement in gcc-6.2 compared to gcc 5.4.&lt;/p&gt;

    });
});
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this benchmark, gcc-6.2 is the clear winner. It is significantly faster
than clang-3.9 and clang-4.0. Moreover, gcc-6.2 is also faster than gcc-5.4.
On the contrary, clang-4.0 is significantly slower than clang-3.9 except on one
configuration (10000 elements).&lt;/p&gt;

});
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no clear difference between the compilers in this code. Every compiler
here has up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the naive implementation of the 2D convolution (units are
milliseconds here not microseconds):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="std_conv2_container" style="min-width: 310px; height:400px; margin: 0 auto; "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        },
        {
            name: 'g++-6.2', data: [9.502, 11.464, 13.903, 16.484, 19.642,
            22.994, 27.004, 31.248, 36.26]
        },
        {

        },
        {
            name: 'zapcc-4.0', data: [5.875, 7.091, 8.661, 10.241, 12.218,

        }
        ]
    });
});
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time the difference is very large! Indeed, clang versions are about 60%
faster than the GCC versions! This is really impressive. Even though this does
not comes close to the optimized. It seems the vectorizer of clang is much more
efficient than the one from GCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4D Convolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final kernel that I'm testing is the batched 4D convolutions that is used a
lot in Deep Learning. This is not really a 4D convolution, but a large number
of 2D convolutions applied on 4D tensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="conv4_container" style="min-width: 310px; height:400px; margin: 0 auto; "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;

    Highcharts.chart('conv4_container', {

        }
        ]
    });
});
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there are very small differences between each version. The best versions
are the most recent versions of the compiler gcc-6.2 and clang-4.0 on a tie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we can see two trends in these results. First, when working with
highly-optimized code, the choice of compiler will not make a huge difference.
On these kind of kernels, gcc-6.2 tend to perform faster than the other
compilers, but only by a very slight margin, except in some cases. On the other
hand, when working with naive implementations, clang versions really did perform
much better than GCC. The clang compiled versions of the 1D and 2D convolutions
are more than 60% faster than their GCC counter parts. This is really
impressive. Overall, clang-4.0 seems to have several performance regressions,
but since it's not still a work in progress, I would not be suprised if these
regressions are not present in the final version. Since the clang-4.0 version is
in fact the clang version used by zapcc, it's also possible that zapcc is
introducing new performance regressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, my advice would be to use GCC-6.2 (or 5.4) on hand-optimized kernels
and clang when you have mostly naive implementations. However, keep in mind that
at least for the example shown here, the naive version optimized by the compiler
never comes close to the highly-optimized version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ever, takes this with a grain of salt, it's only been tested on one project
and one machine, you may obtain very different results on other projects and on
other processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site was becoming slower and slower, the design was not responsive at all
and was an horror on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've changed the design to focus more on content and removed superfluous things
such as the Google profile or slow things such as the 3D tag cloud. Moreover,
the design is now responsive again. It was a matter of removing a lot of bad
things I did in the CSS. Instead of having a vertical and an horizontal bars,
I now have only one vertical bar with both the navigation and a bit more
information. With these changes, the design is now also working on mobile phone!
It's about time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I've also spent quite some time working on the speed of the website.
For this, I've bundled most of the JS and CSS files together and reduced them.
Moreover, the static files are now hosted and cached by CloudFlare. I've also
removed the 3D tag cloud which was quite slow. The Google API usage for the
Google profile badge were also quite slow. Overall, the index page is now really
fast. The article pages are also much faster but it's not perfect, especially
because of Disqus that does tons of requests and redirects everywhere. I've also
got rid of the Disqus ads which were really insignificant in the end. It may
take a while for the ads to disappear according to Disqus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that it's still not perfect, but I hope that user experience on the blog
is now improved for all readers and now article can be read on mobile normally.
I'll try to continue monitoring the speed and usability of the website to see if
I can improve it further in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any issue on the updated website, don't hesitate to let me know
either by commenting on this post or sending me an email (check the Contact
page).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Performance</category><category>The site</category><category>Web</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2016/11/new-design-faster-and-mobile-compatible.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2016 06:55:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>How I improved (a bit) compile time of ETL ?</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2015/06/how-i-improved-a-bit-compile-time-of-etl.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I read several articles about C++ and compile time and I wondered if I could improve the compile time of my Expression Template Library (ETL) project. ETL is a header-only and template-heavy library. I'm not going to the change the design completely or to use type erasure techniques to reduce the compile time, ETL is all about performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a disclaimer, don't expect fancy results from this post, I haven't been able to reduce compile time a lot, but I still wanted to share my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've used g++-4.9.2 to perform these tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm compiling the complete test suite (around 6900 source lines of codes in 36 files) in release mode. Each test file includes the ETL (around 10K SLOC). Each test is run with 8 threads (make -j8). For each result, I have run a complete build 5 times and taken the best result as the final result. Everything is run on a SSD and I have more than enough RAM to handle all the compilation in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference build time was 87.5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="compile-and-generate-dependency-files-at-the-same-time"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compile and generate dependency files at the same time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help write my makefiles, I'm using a set of functions that I have written. This includes automatic dependency generation using -MM -MT options of the compiler. Until now, I had two targets, one to compile the cpp file into the object file and another one to generate the dependency file. I recently saw that compilers were able to do both at the same time! Clang, G++ and the Intel compiler all have a -MD -MF options that lets you generate the dependency file at the same time you compile your file, saving you at least one read of the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My compilation rule in my makefile has now become:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code makefile"&gt;&lt;a name="rest_code_f9f82a2528d84d9bbfcc601928acbaff-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;release/$(1)/%.cpp.o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;/%.&lt;span class="n"&gt;cpp&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name="rest_code_f9f82a2528d84d9bbfcc601928acbaff-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    @ mkdir -p release/&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;/
&lt;a name="rest_code_f9f82a2528d84d9bbfcc601928acbaff-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;CXX&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;CXX_FLAGS&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;RELEASE_FLAGS&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -MD -MF release/&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$$&lt;/span&gt;*.cpp.d -o release/&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$$&lt;/span&gt;*.cpp.o -c &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$$&lt;/span&gt;*.cpp
&lt;a name="rest_code_f9f82a2528d84d9bbfcc601928acbaff-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    @ sed -i -e &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'s@^\(.*\)\.o:@\1.d \1.o:@'&lt;/span&gt; release/&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$$&lt;/span&gt;*.cpp.d
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reduced the compilation time to 86.8 seconds. Not that much reduction, but it still is quite nice to know that. I would have expected this to reduce more the compile time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="use-pragma-once"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use #pragma once&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, I'm not a fan of #pragma since it is not standard, but for now ETL only supports three compilers and only very recent of them, so I have the guarantee that #pragma once is available, so what the hell!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've replaced all the include guards by single #pragma once directives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the results are not impressive, this reduced the compile time to 86.2 seconds. I would only advise to use this if you are sure of the compilers you want to support and you need the extra time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="avoid-iostream"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Avoid &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've read that the &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt; header was one of the slowest to compile of the STL. It is only one that is included several times in my headers only for stream operators and it turns out that there is a &amp;lt;iosfwd&amp;gt; header that forward declares a lot of things from the &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt; and other I/O headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By replacing all &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt; include by &amp;lt;iosfwd&amp;gt;, compile time has gone down to 84.1 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using the three techniques, I've reduced the compile time from 87.5 to 84.1 seconds. I would have honestly hoped for more improvements, but this is a already a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, clang compile time is 45.2 seconds under the same conditions (was 46.2 seconds before the optimizations). It is really much faster :) I'm still using GCC a lot since in several cases, it does generate much better code and in average, the generated code if faster (on my benchmarks at least). I don't have the numbers for icc, but icc is definitely the slowest of the three. When I have it available (at work), I use for release build before running something. The generated executables are generally faster (I only use Intel processors) and sometimes the difference can be quite important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have ideas to reduce further the compile time on this test case, I'd be glad to hear them and put them to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that this small experience would be helpful to some of you :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-techniques"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other techniques&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several other techniques that you can use to reduce compile time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Precompiled Headers are supported by both Clang and GCC, altough not in a compatible. I haven't tested this in a while, but it is quite effective and a very interesting technique. The main problem with this is that is not standard and not compatible between compilers. But it probably is the most efficient techniques when you have lots of headers and lots of templates as in my case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unity builds can make full rebuild much faster. I personally don't like unity builds especially because it is only really good for full builds and you generally don't do full rebuilds that much (I know, I know, this is also the test done in this article :) ). Moreover, it also sucks at doing parallel builds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pimpl idioms and other type erasure techniques can reduce compile time a lot. If it is well done, it can be implemented without so much overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explicit instantiation of templates can also help, but only in the case of a user program. In the case of a library itself, you cannot do anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce inclusions and use forward declarations, obviously...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use tools like distcc (I very rarely use it) and ccache (I generally use it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update your compiler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrade your computer ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>C++</category><category>Compilers</category><category>gcc</category><category>Performance</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2015/06/how-i-improved-a-bit-compile-time-of-etl.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jun 2015 20:00:21 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
