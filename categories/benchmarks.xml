I was sure there was some area of optimizations, so I decided to improve its performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will present the different techniques I applied and their results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Static grammar&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first optimization that I tried was to make the grammar static, meaning that we can declare it static and it will be constructed only once and will be allocated on the data segment.It is indeed heavy to build the lexer especially but also the grammar. I would like to thank &lt;a title="sehe on github" href="https://github.com/sehe"&gt;sehe&lt;/a&gt; for this optimization, he found it after I posted a question on Stackoverflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lexer was very easy to make static (only add static keyword :) ), but the parser was a bit more complicated because it needs the lexer iterator to get the current position in the file. This problem has been resolved by saving the iterator into the qi::locals of the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of this optimization are amazing. It saved 33% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Expectation points&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expectation points have the interesting point that they disallow backtracking and so can improve performances in some cases. Moreover, they are always interesting because they make the grammar clearer and the error messages much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried adding more expectation points to the grammar. Unfortunately, there weren't a lot of them to add. Moreover, it seems that there are some quite weird behavior with them because some times it is impossible to add them (causes compilation failure) and sometimes it just make the code don't work anymore the same way, though I don't understand why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have been able to add some to the grammar. These changes improve the performance by a bit more than 1%. It is not a lot, but it is still an improvement. Moreover, I'm quite sure that there are more expectation points that can be added to the code. I will take some time again later to try to add more and to understand them better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Less skips&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my grammar, I've a special parser for getting the current position in the file to add "debug information" to the AST. This special parser was skipping over its content, but it has no content, since it is artificial. Removing it improved the performance by about half a percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Improve Position (debug information)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said before, there is a special parser to get the current position in the file. This information is then stored into an eddic::ast::Position structure. This structure was holding the line number, the column, the file name and the contents of the line. The first two were ints and the last two were std::string. Each time, a copy of the strings were necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I avoided storing the std::string directly by storing only the number of the line as well as the index of the file. Then, the content of the file is stored in the global context and can be accessed if it is necessary to display the line where the error happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change gave an increase of 10% of the parsing performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Auto Rules&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules in Boost Spirit have an overhead due to the cost of the virtual calls that are necessary. In theory, auto rules can improve the efficiency of the rules by removing the cost of virtual calls. Moreover, auto rules should also avoid code bloat when the rules are compiled. The rules can be inlined and better optimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I transformed some rules to auto rules to improve performances. Unfortunately, I found that this did not improve the performances. Moreover, transforming some rules to auto rules made the performance worse. I still did let some of the rules as auto rules. I have to say that I was very disappointed by this result, I was really expecting more from this :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Generated Static Lexer&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time the lexer is used, it has to generate the Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that is used to identify the different tokens. This process takes time. There is way to avoid this by using the static model of Boost Spirit Lex. With that, the code is generated with the complete DFA and then it doesn't have to be initialized again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not expecting a lot from this because the lexer was already static and so was initialized only once. Indeed, it resulted in less than half a percent improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I've been able to largely reduce the overhead of the parsing by more than 40%, it still has a big overhead. Indeed, it still represents 36 percent of the whole process of compiling a source file. I think it is still too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, an interesting fact is that the optimization I would have thought to be very effective (auto rules especially) did not have the expected effect, but making the grammar static, which I would not have thought of, was very effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When profiled, the final version shows that quite some time is spent in destructing the multi_pass, which is quite odd. And it also seems that transforming the string operators to ast::Operator is not very effective, but I do not know how to improve that at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't probably work on that again for the version 1.2.4 of eddic, but I will eventually take some time again for the version 1.3.0 to improve it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Benchmarks</category><category>Boost</category><category>C++11</category><category>Compilers</category><category>EDDI</category><category>Performances</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2013/06/improving-eddic-boost-spirit-parser-performances.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2013 06:16:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>C++ benchmark – std::vector VS std::list VS std::deque</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2012/12/cpp-benchmark-vector-list-deque.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I wrote a benchmark comparing the performance of std::vector and std::list on different workloads. This previous article received a lot of comments and several suggestions to improve it. The present article is an improvement over the previous article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will compare the performance of std::vector, std::list and std::deque on several different workloads and with different data types. In this article, when I talk about a list refers to std::list, a vector refers to std::vector and deque to std::deque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is generally said that a list should be used when random insert and remove will be performed (performed in O(1) versus O(n) for a vector or a deque). If we look only at the complexity, the scale of linear search in both data structures should be equivalent, complexity being in O(n). When random insert/replace operations are performed on a vector or a deque, all the subsequent data needs to be moved and so each element will be copied. That is why the size of the data type is an important factor when comparing those two data structures. Because the size of the data type will play an important role on the cost of copying an element. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in practice, there is a huge difference: the usage of the memory caches. All the data in a vector is contiguous where the std::list allocates separately memory for each element. How does that change the results in practice ? The deque is a data structure aiming at having the advantages of both data structures without their drawbacks, we will see how it perform in practice. Complexity analysis does not take the memory hierarchy into level. I believe that in practice, memory hierarchy usage is as important as complexity analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that all the tests performed are made on vector, list and deque even if other data structures could be better suited to the given workload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the graphs and in the text, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; is used to refer to the number of elements of the collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the tests performed have been performed on an Intel Core i7 Q 820  @ 1.73GHz. The code has been compiled in 64 bits with GCC 4.7.2 with -02 and -march=native. The code has been compiled with C++11 support (-std=c++11). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each graph, the vertical axis represent the amount of time necessary to perform the operations, so the lower values are the better. The horizontal axis is always the number of elements of the collection. For some graph, the logarithmic scale could be clearer, a button is available after each graph to change the vertical scale to a logarithmic scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data types are varying in size, they hold an array of longs and the size of the array varies to change the size of the data type. The non-trivial data type is made of two longs and has very stupid assignment operator and copy constructor that just does some maths (totally meaningless but costly). One may argue that is not a common copy constructor neither a common assignment operator and one will be right, however, the important point here is that it is costly operators which is enough for this benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fill&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first test that is performed is to fill the data structures by adding elements to the back of the container (using &lt;em&gt;push_back&lt;/em&gt;). Two variations of vector are used, &lt;em&gt;vector_pre&lt;/em&gt; being a std::vector using vector::reserve at the beginning, resulting in only one allocation of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets see the results with a very small data type: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_0" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_0" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_0(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_0'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','list','vector','deque','vector_pre'],['100000',2545,271,2012,317],['200000',4927,552,998,334],['300000',7310,944,1707,595],['400000',9463,936,2056,1099],['500000',12591,1140,2642,1058],['600000',14351,1894,3125,1237],['700000',16561,1995,3686,1208],['800000',18820,2648,4291,1365],['900000',20832,2777,4962,2268],['1000000',23430,3015,5396,2585],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"fill_back - 8 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"us",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_0');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pre-allocated vector is the fastest by a small margin and the list is 3 times slower than a vector. deque and vector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we consider higher data type: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_1" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_1" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_1(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_1'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','list','vector','deque','vector_pre'],['100000',104867,55545,66852,21738],['200000',226215,108289,136035,42532],['300000',340910,198343,153446,60317],['400000',445035,217325,269316,80616],['500000',559619,236576,189613,101371],['600000',688422,391354,303729,122447],['700000',799902,405771,426373,138868],['800000',921441,415707,537057,160637],['900000',1006331,439635,263650,177052],['1000000',1113690,464416,372000,199434],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"fill_back - 4096 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"us",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_1');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time vector and list are performing at about the same speed. The deque is a bit faster than list and vector. The pre-allocated vector is clearly the winner here. The variations in the results of deque and vector are probably coming from my system that doesn't like allocating so much memory back and forth at this speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if we use a non-trivial data type: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_2" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_2" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_2(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_2'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','list','vector','deque','vector_pre'],['100000',8093,8123,10251,8095],['200000',15433,15305,16061,13897],['300000',25964,24643,24450,19954],['400000',33414,30322,32148,27171],['500000',40416,37817,40752,35058],['600000',48991,48594,48785,41049],['700000',55059,55124,55092,47609],['800000',63688,61360,64505,55659],['900000',70550,67636,72329,60952],['1000000',79271,73533,79522,67787],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"fill_back - 16 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"us",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_2');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data structures are performing more or less the same, with vector_pre being the fastest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For push_back operations, pre-allocated vectors is a very good choice if the size is known in advance. The others performs more of less the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have expected a better result for pre-allocated vector. If someone find an explanation for such a small margin, I'm interested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Linear Search&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first operation is that is tested is the search. The container is filled with all the numbers in [0, N] and shuffled. Then, each number in [0,N] is searched in the container with std::find that performs a simple linear search. In theory, all the data structures should perform the same if we consider their complexity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_3" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_3" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_3(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_3'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['1000',593,1098,318],['2000',2927,5307,1271],['3000',5891,12228,3020],['4000',8663,24415,5081],['5000',12859,36316,8066],['6000',18493,55057,11463],['7000',25057,74344,16022],['8000',38980,99990,21051],['9000',44951,127575,26650],['10000',52281,158216,32557],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"linear_search - 8 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"us",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_3');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear from the graph that the list has very poor performance for searching. The growth is much worse for a list than for a vector or a deque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason is the usage of the cache line. When a data is accessed, the data is fetched from the main memory to the cache. Not only the accessed data is accessed, but a whole cacheline is fetched. As the elements in a vector are contiguous, when you access an element, the next element is automatically in the cache. As the main memory is orders of magnitude slower than the cache, this makes a huge difference. In the list case, the processor spends its whole time waiting for data being fetched from memory to the cache, at each fetch, the processor fetches a lot of unnecessary data that are almost always useless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deque is a bit slower than the vector, that is logical because here there are more cache misses due to the segmented parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take a bigger data type: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_4" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_4" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_4(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_4'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['1000',1116,2683,776],['2000',4983,16675,3537],['3000',12255,44379,10874],['4000',23212,83026,20189],['5000',37392,133353,33609],['6000',55295,193428,47636],['7000',74877,261314,63911],['8000',100903,340157,84647],['9000',126299,435816,107922],['10000',156386,545160,135680],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"linear_search - 128 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"us",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_4');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list is still much slower than the others, but what is interesting is that gap between the deque and the array is decreasing. Let's try with a 4KB data type: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="graph_5" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_5" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_5(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_5'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['1000',4258,7190,4445],['2000',20584,38411,19825],['3000',48236,113189,55341],['4000',87475,223174,118453],['5000',136945,362421,191967],['6000',197856,530943,281252],['7000',273359,726323,387940],['8000',351223,954463,511276],['9000',447525,1211581,652269],['10000',551556,1497916,807161],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"linear_search - 4096 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"us",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_5');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of the list are still poor but the gap is decreasing. The interesting point is that deque is now faster than vector. I'm not really sure of the reason of this result. It is possible that it comes only from this special size. One thing is sure, the bigger the data size, the more cache misses the processor will get because elements don't fit in cache lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For search, list is clearly slow where deque and vector have about the same performance. It seems that deque is faster than a vector for very large data sizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Random Insert (+Linear Search)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of random insert, in theory, the list should be much faster, its insert operation being in O(1) versus O(n) for a vector or a deque. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container is filled with all the numbers in [0, N] and shuffled. Then, 1000 random values are inserted at a random position in the container. The random position is found by linear search. In both cases, the complexity of the search is O(n), the only difference comes from the insert that follow the search. We saw before that the performance of the list were poor for searching, so we'll see if the fast insertion can compensate the slow search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_6" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_6" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_6(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_6'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['10000',8,27,8],['20000',15,45,14],['30000',22,63,21],['40000',29,74,27],['50000',37,87,38],['60000',43,105,44],['70000',50,114,48],['80000',61,130,55],['90000',66,139,61],['100000',70,155,68],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"random_insert - 8 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_6');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List is clearly slower than the other two data structures that exhibit the same performance. This comes from the very slow linear search. Even if the two other data structures have to move a lot of data, the copy is cheap for small data types. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's increase the size a bit: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_7" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_7" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_7(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_7'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['10000',21,53,25],['20000',39,80,48],['30000',57,103,68],['40000',71,122,90],['50000',88,146,112],['60000',102,165,130],['70000',124,190,152],['80000',140,214,175],['90000',157,238,195],['100000',174,268,213],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"random_insert - 32 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_7');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result are interesting. The list is still the slowest but with a smaller margin. This time deque is faster than the vector by a small margin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, increasing the data size: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_8" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_8" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_8(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_8'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['10000',64,80,89],['20000',108,128,154],['30000',158,182,248],['40000',212,248,347],['50000',281,348,469],['60000',402,443,735],['70000',569,643,1034],['80000',767,775,1347],['90000',978,1002,1614],['100000',1190,1202,1962],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"random_insert - 128 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_8');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, the vector is clearly the looser and deque and list have the same performance. We can say that with a size of 128 bytes, the time to move a lot of the elements is more expensive than searching in the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge data type gives us clearer results: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_9" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_9" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_9(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_9'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['10000',4430,178,8074],['20000',7918,311,14121],['30000',11043,444,20014],['40000',13806,555,26783],['50000',17421,694,33519],['60000',20663,904,39175],['70000',23599,1147,45111],['80000',26736,1470,50887],['90000',29524,1940,60139],['100000',32005,2534,65098],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"random_insert - 4096 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_9');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list is more than 20 times faster than the vector and an order of magnitude faster than the deque ! The deque is also twice faster than the vector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact than the deque is faster than vector is quite simple. When an insertion is made in a deque, the elements can either moved to the end or the beginning. The closer point will be chosen. An insert in the middle is the most costly operation with O(n/2) complexity. It is always more efficient to insert elements in a deque than in vector because at least twice less elements will be moved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the non-trivial data type: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_10" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_10" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_10(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_10'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['10000',230,41,425],['20000',376,65,705],['30000',552,84,1054],['40000',692,101,1345],['50000',862,119,1661],['60000',1003,141,1984],['70000',1186,155,2277],['80000',1358,172,2681],['90000',1540,186,2965],['100000',1658,203,3236],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"random_insert - 16 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_10');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are about the same as for the previous graph, but the data type is only 16B. The cost of the copy constructors and assignment operators is very important for vector and deque. The list doesn't care because no copy neither assignment of the existing elements is made during insertions (only the inserted element is copied). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Random Remove&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, random remove is the same case than random insert. Now that we've seen the results with random insert, we could expect the same behavior for random remove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container is filled with all the numbers in [0, N] and shuffled. Then, 1000 random values are removed from a random position in the container. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take the same data sizes as the random insert case: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_11" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_11" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_11(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_11'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['10000',6,19,5],['20000',12,41,11],['30000',20,55,18],['40000',27,68,25],['50000',34,81,33],['60000',43,101,40],['70000',49,113,45],['80000',59,126,52],['90000',67,138,61],['100000',72,157,65],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"random_remove - 8 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_11');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_12" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_12" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_12(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_12'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['10000',40,40,63],['20000',85,83,134],['30000',127,132,198],['40000',181,189,282],['50000',245,263,473],['60000',363,376,664],['70000',524,502,960],['80000',743,688,1343],['90000',977,812,1639],['100000',1228,1017,2004],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"random_remove - 128 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_12');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_13" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_13" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_13(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_13'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['10000',2906,109,5649],['20000',6190,233,11760],['30000',9379,359,18218],['40000',12840,490,23634],['50000',16027,585,30046],['60000',18918,773,36100],['70000',22213,999,42453],['80000',25788,1317,48793],['90000',28975,1762,55043],['100000',30860,2128,59791],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"random_remove - 4096 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_13');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_14" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_14" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_14(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_14'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['10000',149,27,294],['20000',319,50,608],['30000',481,68,934],['40000',638,89,1236],['50000',794,108,1547],['60000',954,120,1894],['70000',1101,144,2185],['80000',1253,160,2513],['90000',1399,177,2812],['100000',1595,194,3108],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"random_remove - 16 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_14');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavior of random remove is the same as the behavior of random insert, for the same reasons. The results are not very interesting, so, let's get to the next workload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Push Front&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next operation that we will compare is inserting elements in front of the collection. This is the worst case for vector, because after each insertion, all the previously inserted will be moved and copied. For a list or a deque, it does not make a difference compared to pushing to the back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's see the results: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_15" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_15" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_15(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_15'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['10000',0,0,33],['20000',0,0,135],['30000',0,0,313],['40000',0,0,585],['50000',0,1,913],['60000',0,1,1327],['70000',0,1,1823],['80000',0,1,2405],['90000',0,2,3107],['100000',0,2,4017],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"fill_front - 8 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_15');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are crystal-clear and as expected, vector is very bad at inserting elements to the front. The list and the deque results are almost invisible in the graph because it is a free operation for the two data structures. This does not need further explanations. There is no need to change the data size, it will only make vector much slower and my processor hotter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sort&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next operation that is tested is the time necessary to sort the data structures. For the vector and the deque std::sort is used and for a list the member function sort is used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_16" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_16" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_16(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_16'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['100000',9,25,6],['200000',19,61,14],['300000',29,115,22],['400000',40,175,30],['500000',50,233,39],['600000',60,321,48],['700000',71,378,57],['800000',85,457,66],['900000',95,517,74],['1000000',108,593,83],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"sort - 8 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_16');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a small data type, the list is several times slower than the other two data structures. This is again due to the very poor spatial locality of the list during the search. vector is slightly faster than a deque, but the difference is not very significant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we increase the size: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_17" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_17" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_17(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_17'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['100000',25,32,20],['200000',65,80,48],['300000',103,143,80],['400000',136,197,113],['500000',180,246,149],['600000',223,340,181],['700000',274,396,222],['800000',302,469,266],['900000',358,514,303],['1000000',395,579,337],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"sort - 128 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_17');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order remains the same but the difference between the list and the other is decreasing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a 1KB data type: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_18" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_18" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_18(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_18'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['100000',176,39,168],['200000',389,94,376],['300000',620,168,595],['400000',859,228,823],['500000',1100,285,1059],['600000',1355,392,1301],['700000',1609,452,1555],['800000',1844,539,1797],['900000',2111,597,2054],['1000000',2397,670,2278],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"sort - 1024 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_18');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list is almost five times faster than the vector and the deque which are both performing the same (with a very slight advantage for vector). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we use the non-trivial data type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_19" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_19" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_19(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_19'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['100000',92,26,89],['200000',195,70,188],['300000',301,135,296],['400000',410,195,399],['500000',519,255,510],['600000',638,350,623],['700000',763,410,729],['800000',858,492,846],['900000',971,552,954],['1000000',1090,628,1072],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"sort - 16 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_19');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the cost of the operators of this type have a strong impact on the vector and deque. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Destruction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next test is to calculate the time necessary to the destruction of a container. The containers are dynamically allocated, are filled with n numbers and then their destruction time (via delete) is computed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_20" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_20" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_20(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_20'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['100000',34,1489,0],['200000',70,2838,0],['300000',102,4677,0],['400000',142,6072,0],['500000',173,7737,0],['600000',215,8828,0],['700000',353,10599,1],['800000',321,12115,0],['900000',355,13932,1],['1000000',410,15345,0],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"destruction - 8 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_20');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are already interesting. The vector is almost free to destroy, which is logical because that incurs only freeing one array and the vector itself. The deque is slower due to the freeing of each segments. But the list is much more costly than the other two, more than an order of magnitude slower. This is expected because the list have to free the dynamic memory of each node and also has to iterate through all the elements which we saw was slow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we increase the data type: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_21" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_21" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_21(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_21'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['100000',898,4403,1],['200000',2488,8499,1],['300000',4091,12499,1430],['400000',5461,16379,1909],['500000',6729,21128,2459],['600000',8164,25719,2729],['700000',9517,31046,3227],['800000',10871,34550,3756],['900000',12392,37176,4163],['1000000',13762,40119,4523],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"destruction - 128 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_21');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we can see that the deque is three times slower than a vector and that the list is still an order of magnitude slower than a vector ! However, the is less difference than before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our biggest data type, now: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_22" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_22" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_22(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_22'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['100000',20575,22434,15499],['200000',44234,47254,29848],['300000',67196,69374,39818],['400000',89253,91128,54229],['500000',108689,112557,68090],['600000',131751,135764,75063],['700000',150801,155610,90761],['800000',172365,176957,102830],['900000',192575,193897,112728],['1000000',211507,215274,126348],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"destruction - 4096 bytes",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_22');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no more difference between list and deque. The vector is still twice faster than them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the vector is always faster than the list and deque, keep in mind that the graphs for destruction are in microseconds and so the operations are not very costly. It could make a difference is very time-sensitive application but unlikely in most applications. Moreover, destruction is made only once per data structure, generally, it is not a very important operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Number Crunching&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can also test a number crunching operation. Here, random elements are inserted into the container that is kept sorted. It means, that the position where the element has to be inserted is first searched by iterating through elements and the inserted. As we talk about number crunching, only 8 bytes elements are tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_23" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_23" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_23(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_23'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','deque','list','vector'],['10000',39,187,33],['20000',150,1247,134],['30000',339,3380,310],['40000',623,6513,547],['50000',958,10757,864],['60000',1394,16098,1257],['70000',1894,22623,1713],['80000',2479,30656,2249],['90000',3162,39451,2858],['100000',3932,49906,3576],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"number_crunching",width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Number of elements",slantedText:true},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_23');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if there is only 100'000 elements, the list is already an order of magnitude slower than the other two data structures. If we look a the curves of the results, it is easy to see that this will be only worse with higher collection sizes. The list is absolutely not adapted for number crunching operations due to its poor spatial locality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, we can get some facts about each data structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;std::list is very very slow to iterate through the collection due to its very poor spatial locality.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;std::vector and std::deque perform always faster than std::list with very small data&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;std::list handles very well large elements&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;std::deque performs better than a std::vector for inserting at random positions (especially at the front, which is constant time)&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;std::deque and std::vector do not support very well data types with high cost of copy/assignment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This draw simple conclusions on usage of each data structure: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Number crunching: use std::vector or std::deque&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Linear search: use std::vector or std::deque&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Random Insert/Remove: use std::list (if data size very small (
   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Big data size: use std::list (not if intended for searching)&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Non-trivial data type: use std::list unless you need the container especially for searching. But for multiple modifications of the container, it will be very slow. &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Push to front: use std::deque or std::list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say that before writing this new version of the benchmark I did not know std::deque a lot. This is a very good data structure that is very good at inserting at both ends and even in the middle while exposing a very good spatial locality. Even if sometimes slower than a vector, when the operations involves both searching and inserting in the middle, I would say that this structure should be preferred over vectors, especially for data types of medium sizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the time, in practice, the best way to decide is always to benchmark each version, or even to try another data structures. Two operations with the same Big O complexity can perform quite differently in practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C++, the two most used data structures are the std::vector and the std::list. In this article, we will compare the performance in practice of these two data structures on several different workloads. In this article, when I talk about a list it is the std::list implementation and vector refers to the std::vector implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is generally said that a list should be used when random insert and remove will be performed (performed in O(1) versus O(n) for a vector). If we look only at the complexity, search in both data structures should be roughly equivalent, complexity being in O(n). When random insert/replace operations are performed on a vector, all the subsequent data needs to be moved and so each element will be copied. That is why the size of the data type is an important factor when comparing those two data structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in practice, there is a huge difference, the usage of the memory caches. All the data in a vector is contiguous where the std::list allocates separately memory for each element. How does that change the results in practice ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that all the tests performed are made on vector and list even if other data structures could be better suited to the given workload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the graphs and in the text, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; is used to refer to the number of elements of the collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the tests performed have been performed on an Intel Core i7 Q 820  @ 1.73GHz. The code has been compiled in 64 bits with GCC 4.7.2 with -02 and -march=native. The code has been compiled with C++11 support (-std=c++11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fill&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first test that is performed is to fill the data structures by adding elements to the back of the container. Two variations of vector are used, vector_pre being a std::vector with the size passed in parameters to the constructor, resulting in only one allocation of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_0" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_0" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_0(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_0'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','vector_pre','vector','list'],['1000',0,0,1],['10000',0,1,10],['100000',4,11,100],['1000000',7,234,1023]]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"Fill (8 bytes)",width:'600px',height:'400px',vAxis:{title:"Milliseconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_0');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="graph_1" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_1" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_1(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_1'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','vector_pre','vector','list'],['1000',0,9,1],['10000',12,245,18],['100000',949,2635,1153],['1000000',9138,23654,11270]]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"Fill (1024 bytes)",width:'600px',height:'400px',vAxis:{title:"Milliseconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_1');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data structures are impacted the same way when the data size increases, because there will be more memory to allocate. The vector_pre is clearly the winner of this test, being one order of magnitude faster than a list and about twice faster than a vector without pre-allocation. The result are directly linked to the allocations that have to be performed, allocation being slow. Whatever the data size is, push_back to a vector will always be faster than to a list. This is logical becomes vector allocates more memory than necessary and so does not need to allocate memory for each element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this test is not very interesting, generally building the data structure is not critical. What is critical is the operations that are performed on the data structure. That will be tested in the next sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Random Find&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first operation is that is tested is the search. The container is filled with all the numbers in [0, N] and shuffled. Then, each number in [0,N] is searched in the container with std::find that performs a simple linear search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_2" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_2" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_2(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_2'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','vector','list'],['100',0,11],['1000',0,1545],['5000',0,35886],['10000',0,150865],['20000',0,614496]]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"Find (8 bytes)",width:'600px',height:'400px',vAxis:{title:"Microseconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_2');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, vector is present in the graph, its line is the same as the x line ! Performing a &lt;strong&gt;linear search in a vector is several orders of magnitude faster than in a list&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason is the usage of the cache line. When a data is accessed, the data is fetched from the main memory to the cache. Not only the accessed data is accessed, but a whole cacheline is fetched. As the elements in a vector are contiguous, when you access an element, the next element is automatically in the cache. As the main memory is orders of magnitude slower than the cache, this makes a huge difference. In the list case, the processor spends its whole time waiting for data being fetched from memory to the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we augment the size of the data type to 1KB, the results remain the same, but slower:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_3" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_3" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_3(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_3'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','vector','list'],['100',0,11],['1000',0,3551],['5000',0,195429],['10000',0,829631],['20000',0,3356432]]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"Find (1024 bytes)",width:'600px',height:'400px',vAxis:{title:"Microseconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_3');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Random Insert&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of random insert, in theory, the list should be much faster, its insert operation being in O(1) versus O(n) for a vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container is filled with all the numbers in [0, N] and shuffled. Then, 1000 random values are inserted at a random position in the container. The random position is found by linear search. In both cases, the complexity of the search is O(n), the only difference comes from the insert that follow the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_4" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_4" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_4(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_4'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','vector','list'],['1000',9,85],['2000',9,85],['4000',10,94],['6000',12,98],['8000',13,106],['10000',14,106]]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"Insert (8 bytes)",width:'600px',height:'400px',vAxis:{title:"Milliseconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_4');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When, the vector should be slower than the list, it is almost an order of magnitude faster. Again, this is because finding the position in a list is much slower than copying a lot of small elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we increase the size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_5" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_5" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_5(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_5'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','vector','list'],['1000',27,120],['2000',30,113],['4000',34,122],['6000',37,140],['8000',42,145],['10000',47,155]]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"Insert (32 bytes)",width:'600px',height:'400px',vAxis:{title:"Milliseconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_5');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two lines are getting closer, but vector is still faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increase it to 1KB:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_6" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_6" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_6(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_6'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','vector','list'],['1000',1821,167],['2000',1941,163],['4000',2383,191],['6000',2679,207],['8000',2960,214],['10000',3308,228]]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"Insert (1024 bytes)",width:'600px',height:'400px',vAxis:{title:"Milliseconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_6');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, list outperforms vector by an order of magnitude ! The performance of random insert in a list are not impacted much by the size of the data type, where vector suffers a lot when big sizes are used. We can also see that list doesn't seem to care about the size of the collection. It is because the size of the collection only impact the search and not the insertion and as few search are performed, it does not change the results a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the iterator was already known (no need for linear search), it would be faster to insert into a list than into the vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Random Remove&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, random remove is the same case than random insert. Now that we've seen the results with random insert, we could expect the same behavior for random remove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container is filled with all the numbers in [0, N] and shuffled. Then, 1000 random values are removed from a random position in the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_7" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_7" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_7(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_7'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','vector','list'],['100',0,0],['1000',0,0],['10000',40,0],['50000',949,2],['100000',3937,4],['200000',16003,9],['300000',42393,12]]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"Push front (8 bytes)",width:'600px',height:'400px',vAxis:{title:"Milliseconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_7');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, vector is several times faster and looks to scale better. Again, this is because it is very cheap to copy small elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's increase it directly to 1KB element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_8" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_8" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_8(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_8'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','vector','list'],['1000',0,0],['10000',2,26],['100000',163,684],['1000000',2147,15950],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"Sort (8 bytes)",width:'600px',height:'400px',vAxis:{title:"Milliseconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_8');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two lines have been reversed !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavior of random remove is the same as the behavior of random insert, for the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Push Front&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next operation that we will compare is inserting elements in front of the collection. This is the worst case for vector, because after each insertion, all the previously inserted will be moved and copied. For a list, it does not make a difference compared to pushing to the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_9" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_9" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_9(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_9'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','vector','list'],['100',0,0],['1000',0,0],['10000',40,0],['50000',949,2],['100000',3937,4],['200000',16003,9],['300000',42393,12]]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"Push front (8 bytes)",width:'600px',height:'400px',vAxis:{title:"Milliseconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_9');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are crystal-clear and as expected. vector is very bad at inserting elements to the front. This does not need further explanations. There is no need to change the data size, it will only make vector much slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sort&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next operation that is tested is the performance of sorting a vector or a list. For a vector std::sort is used and for a list the member function sort is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_10" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_10" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_10(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_10'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','vector','list'],['1000',0,0],['10000',2,26],['100000',163,684],['1000000',2147,15950],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"Sort (8 bytes)",width:'600px',height:'400px',vAxis:{title:"Milliseconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_10');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that sorting a list is several times slower. It comes from the poor usage of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we increase the size of the element to 1KB:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_11" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_11" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_11(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_11'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','vector','list'],['1000',2,0],['10000',224,50],['100000',4289,1083],['1000000',50973,17975],]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"Sort (1024 bytes)",width:'600px',height:'400px',vAxis:{title:"Milliseconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_11');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time the list is faster than the vector. It is not very clear on the graph, but the values for the list are almost the same as for the previous results. That is because std::list::sort() does not perform any copy, only pointers to the elements are changed. On the other hand, swapping two elements in a vector involves at least three copies, so the cost of sorting will increase as the cost of copying increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Number Crunching&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can also test a number crunching operation. Here, random elements are inserted into the container that is kept sorted. It means, that the position where the element has to be inserted is first searched by iterating through elements and the inserted. As we talk about number crunching, only 8 bytes elements are tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_12" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_12" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_12(){var graph=new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('graph_12'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','vector','list'],['1000',0,0],['10000',45,166],['50000',928,10665],['100000',3753,50766],['200000',15185,231480],['300000',34293,715892]]);var options={curveType:"function",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},title:"Random Sorted Insert (8 bytes)",width:'600px',height:'400px',vAxis:{title:"Milliseconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_12');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can clearly see that vector is more than an order of magnitude faster than list and this will only be more as the size of the collection increase. This is because traversing the list is much more expensive than copying the elements of the vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, we can get some facts about each data structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;std::vector is insanely faster than std::list to find an element&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;std::vector performs always faster than std::list with very small data&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;std::vector is always faster to push elements at the back than std::list&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;std::list handles very well large elements, especially for sorting or inserting in the front&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This draw simple conclusions on usage of each data structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Number crunching: use std::vector&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Linear search: use std::vector&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Random Insert/Remove: use std::list (if data size very small (&amp;lt; 64B on my computer), use std::vector)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Big data size: use std::list (not if intended for searching)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have the time, in practice, the best way to decide is always to benchmark both versions, or even to try another data structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that you found this article interesting. If you have any comment or have an idea about an other workload that you would like to test, don't hesitate to post a comment ;) If you have a question on results, don't hesitate as well.&lt;/p&gt;

The tests are done using GCC 4.7.2 and CLang 3.1 on Gentoo.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Compilation Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I tested has been the compilation time of the two compilers to compile eddic with different flags. I tested the compilation in debug mode and with -O2 and -O3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_0" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_0" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_0(){var graph=new google.visualization.ColumnChart(document.getElementById('graph_0'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['Options','GCC','CLang'],['-g',234.59,119.59],['-O2',273.02,178.22],['-O3',276.87,183.78],]);var options={title:"Compilation Time - Less is better",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},width:'400px',height:'300px',hAxis:{title:"Options"},vAxis:{title:"Seconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_0');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting fact in these results is that CLang is much faster than GCC. It takes twice less times to compile eddic with CLang in debug mode than with GCC. The impact on optimizations on CLang's compilation is also more important than on GCC. For both compilers, -O3 does not seems to add a lot of overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Runtime performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I tested the performance of the generated executable. I tested it on three things, the whole test suite and two test cases that I know are the slowest for the EDDI Compiler. For each case, I took the slowest value of 5 consecutive executions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_1" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_1" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_1(){var graph=new google.visualization.ColumnChart(document.getElementById('graph_1'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['Compiler','GCC -O2','GCC -O3','CLang -O2','CLang -O3'],['testsuite',6.58,6.59,6.74,6.58],['assembly',1.2,1.2,1.2,1.2],['linked_list',0.51,0.5,0.49,0.49],]);var options={title:"Runtime Performance - Less is better",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Options"},vAxis:{title:"Seconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_1');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference are very small. In -02, GCC performs a bit better, but in -O3, the performance are equivalent. I was a bit disappointed by the results, because I thought that there would be higher differences. It seems that CLang is not as far from GCC that some people would like to say. It also certainly depends on the program being compiled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that CLang is much faster than GCC to compile eddic. Moreover, the performance of the generated executable are almost similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue to use CLang as my development compiler and switches between the two when I'm doing performance benchmarking. I will try to update the benchmark once new versions of GCC / CLang are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the sorting algorithms that are used are generally comparison sort. It means that each element of the collection being sorted will be compared to see which one is the first one. A comparison must have a lower bound of Ω(n log n) comparisons. That is why there are no comparison-based sorting algorithm better than O(n log n).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are also sorting algorithms that are performing better. This is the family of the integer sorting algorithms. These algorithms are using properties of integer to sort them without comparing them. They can be only be used to sort integers. Nevertheless, a hash function can be used to assign a unique integer to any value and so sort any value. All these algorithms are using extra space. There are several of these algorithms. In this article, we will see three of them and I will present an implementation in C++. At the end of the article, I will compare them to &lt;em&gt;std::sort&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the article, I will use &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; as the size of the array to sort and &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; as the max number that is permitted in the array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bin Sort&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bin Sort, or Bucket Sort, is a very simple algorithm that partition all the input numbers into a number of buckets. Then, all the buckets are outputted in order in the array, resulting in a sorting array. I decided to implement the simplest case of Bin Sort where each number goes in its own bucket, so there are &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; buckets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation is pretty straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;binsort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MAX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SIZE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;push_back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MAX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;B is the array of buckets. Each bucket is implemented as a std::vector. The algorithm starts by filling each buckets with the numbers from the input array. Then, it outputs them in order in the array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This algorithm works in &lt;em&gt;O(n + m)&lt;/em&gt; and requires &lt;em&gt;O(m)&lt;/em&gt; extra memory. With these properties, it makes a very limited algorithm, because if you don't know the maximum number and you have to use the maximum number of the array type, you will have to allocate for instance 2^32 buckets. That won't be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Couting Sort&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting fact about binsort is that each bucket contains only the same numbers. The size of the bucket would be enough. That is exactly what Counting Sort. It counts the number of times an element is present instead of the elements themselves. I will present two versions. The first one is a version using a secondary array and then copying again into the input array and the second one is an in-place sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;counting_sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SIZE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MAX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SIZE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MAX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SIZE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SIZE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The algorithm is also simple. It starts by counting the number of elements in each bucket. Then, it aggregates the number by summing them to obtain the position of the element in the final sorted array. Then, all the elements are copied in the temporary array. Finally, the temporary array is copied in the final array. This algorithms works in &lt;em&gt;O(m + n)&lt;/em&gt; and requires &lt;em&gt;O(m + n)&lt;/em&gt;. This version is presented only because it is present in the literature. We can do much better by avoiding the temporary array and optimizing it a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;in_place_counting_sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MAX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SIZE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MAX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The temporary array is removed and the elements are directly written in the sorted array. The counts are not used directly as position, so there is no need to sum them. This version still works in &lt;em&gt;O(m + n)&lt;/em&gt; but requires only &lt;em&gt;O(m)&lt;/em&gt; extra memory. It is much faster than the previous version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Radix Sort&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last version that I will discuss here is a Radix Sort. This algorithm sorts the number digit after digit in a specific radix. It is a form of bucket sort, where there is a bucket by digit. Like Counting Sort, only the counts are necessary. For example, if you use radix sort in base 10. It will first sort all the numbers by their first digit, then the second, .... It can work in any base and that is its force. With a well chosen base, it can be very powerful. Here, we will focus on radix that are in the form 2^r. These radix have good properties, we can use shifts and mask to perform division and modulo, making the algorithm much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation is a bit more complex than the other implementations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Digits&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;                 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Bits&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;radix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Bins&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;radix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;radix_sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SIZE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cnt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;radix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="n"&gt;cnt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SIZE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;radix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;cnt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cnt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SIZE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cnt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SIZE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; indicates the power of two used as the radix (2^r). The mask is used to compute modulo faster. The algorithm repeats the steps for each digit. Here &lt;em&gt;digits&lt;/em&gt; equals 2. It means that we support 2^32 values. A 32 bits value is sorted in two pass. The steps are very similar to counting sort. Each value of the digit is counted and then the counts are summed to give the position of the number. Finally, the numbers are put in order in the temporary array and copied into A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This algorithm works in &lt;em&gt;O(digits (m + radix))&lt;/em&gt; and requires &lt;em&gt;O(n + radix)&lt;/em&gt; extra memory. A very good thing is that the algorithm does not require space based on the maximum value, only based on the radix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's time to compare the different implementations in terms of runtime. For each size, each version is tested 25 times on different random arrays. The arrays are the same for each algorithm. The number is the time necessary to sort the 25 arrays. The benchmark has been compiler with GCC 4.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first test is made with very few duplicates (m = 10n).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_0" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_0" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_0(){var graph=new google.visualization.ColumnChart(document.getElementById('graph_0'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','std::sort','counting_sort','in_place_counting_sort','bin_sort','radix_sort'],['100000',171,182,105,945,89],['500000',993,2229,970,6435,461],['1000000',2175,4812,2046,14096,1068],['5000000',11791,27050,10202,81255,6148],]);var options={title:"m = 10n",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"n"},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_0');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radix Sort comes to be the fastest in this case, &lt;strong&gt;twice faster as &lt;em&gt;std::sort&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In place counting sort has almost the same performance as &lt;em&gt;std::sort&lt;/em&gt;. The other are performing worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second test is made with few duplicates (m ~= n).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_1" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_1" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_1(){var graph=new google.visualization.ColumnChart(document.getElementById('graph_1'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','std::sort','counting_sort','in_place_counting_sort','bin_sort','radix_sort'],['100000',186,73,37,309,90],['500000',991,611,189,3126,455],['1000000',2235,2171,547,7978,1038],['5000000',12184,18470,4516,49056,5791],]);var options={title:"m ~= n",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"n"},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_1');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers are impressive. In place &lt;strong&gt;counting sort is between 3-4 times faster than &lt;em&gt;std::sort&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;radix sort is twice faster than &lt;em&gt;std::sort&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ! Bin Sort does not performs very well and counting sort even if generally faster than &lt;em&gt;std::sort&lt;/em&gt; does not scale very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's test with more duplicates (m = n / 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_2" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_2" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_2(){var graph=new google.visualization.ColumnChart(document.getElementById('graph_2'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','std::sort','counting_sort','in_place_counting_sort','bin_sort','radix_sort'],['100000',178,65,25,262,90],['500000',979,450,143,2332,461],['1000000',2171,1480,321,6240,1041],['5000000',11978,16205,3453,41709,5890],]);var options={title:"m = n / 2",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"n"},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_2');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;std::sort&lt;/em&gt; and radix sort performance does not change a lot but the other sort are performing better. In-place counting sort is still the leader with a higher margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, with a lot of duplicates (m = n / 10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_3" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_3" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_3(){var graph=new google.visualization.ColumnChart(document.getElementById('graph_3'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['x','std::sort','counting_sort','in_place_counting_sort','bin_sort','radix_sort'],['100000',161,46,12,144,74],['500000',918,322,76,1023,449],['1000000',2062,824,167,2721,1041],['5000000',10789,8534,1030,24026,5686],]);var options={title:"m = n / 10n",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"n"},vAxis:{title:"ms",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_3');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, &lt;em&gt;std::sort&lt;/em&gt; and radix sort performance are stable, but in-place counting is now &lt;strong&gt;ten times faster than &lt;em&gt;std::sort&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, we have seen that these algorithms can outperforms &lt;em&gt;std::sort&lt;/em&gt; by a high factor (10 times for In place Counting Sort when there m &amp;lt;&amp;lt; n). If you have to sort integers, you should consider these two cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;m &amp;gt; n or m is unknown : Use radix sort that is about twice faster than &lt;em&gt;std::sort&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;m &amp;lt;&amp;lt; n : Use in place counting sort that can be much faster than &lt;em&gt;std::sort&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this small post, I will present the results of a little benchmark I did run to compare the different techniques. In this benchmark, the critical section is a single increment to an integer. The critical section is protected using three techniques:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A single std::mutex with calls to lock() and unlock()&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A single std::mutex locked with std::lock_guard&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An atomic reference on the integer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tests have been made with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 threads. Each test is repeated 5 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are presented in the following figure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2012/07/c11-synchronization-benchmark/synchronization_cpp_benchmarks/" rel="attachment wp-att-2071"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-2071  " title="C++11 Synchronization Benchmark Result" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/synchronization_cpp_benchmarks-300x230.png" alt="C++11 Synchronization Benchmark Result" width="300" height="230"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, the mutex versions are much slower than the atomic one. An interesting point is that the the atomic version has not a very good scalability. I would have expected that the impact of adding one thread would not be that high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also surprised that the lock guard version has a non-negligible overhead when there are few threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, do not locks when all you need is modifying integral types. For that, std::atomic is much faster. Good Lock-Free algorithms are almost always faster than the algorithms with lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now all my benchmarks will be pushed to this repository. This is more simple for me to manage and more secure also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, there is seven benchmarks on the repository :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Closest Pair Search Benchmark : A benchmark to test two closest pair point search algorithms : the naive one and the &lt;strong&gt;sweeping plane&lt;/strong&gt; one. &lt;a title="Closest Pair Search Benchmark Results" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/04/closest-pair-of-point-plane-sweep-algorithm/" target="_blank"&gt;Results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Unmodifiable Benchmark : A benchmark to test the performances of &lt;strong&gt;unmodifiable collection&lt;/strong&gt; versus creating a copy of the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you'll find these sources interesting. If you found errors or improvements, don't hesitate to comment to tell me what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Benchmarks</category><category>Git</category><category>Java</category><category>Performances</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2010/09/my-java-benchmarks-on-github.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2010 05:16:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Java Synchronization (Mutual Exclusion) Benchmark</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2010/09/java-synchronization-mutual-exclusion-benchmark.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've created another benchmark. This time, I've benchmarked the different ways of synchronizing a little code using &lt;strong&gt;mutual exclusion&lt;/strong&gt; on this code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code to protect will be very simple. It's a simple counter :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Init&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Critical section&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The critical section, if not protected with synchronization system, will not function properly due to possible &lt;strong&gt;interleavings&lt;/strong&gt; (read &lt;a href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/08/java-concurrrency-synchronization-locks/" target="_blank"&gt;the article on synchronization&lt;/a&gt; if you don't know what is &lt;strong&gt;interleaving&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've used 3 different synchronizers to synchronize this increment :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;synchronized block&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Semaphores (fair and unfair)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Explicit locks (fair and unfair)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also used a third way to solve the problem with AtomicInteger. This is not the same as the other ways because it does not provide mutual exclusion but this is a good way to synchronize simple values, like integers or boolean, but also references. The atomicity of the operations of the AtomicInteger is made using the compare-and-swap operation of the operating system. So there is no waiting operations. So there is less context switches and result in more performing code normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the code of these 4 ways to solve the problems :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SynchronizedRunnable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Runnable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;synchronized&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ReentrantLockRunnable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Runnable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Lock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;ReentrantLockRunnable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ReentrantLock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;unlock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SemaphoreRunnable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Runnable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Semaphore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;semaphore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;SemaphoreRunnable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;semaphore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Semaphore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;semaphore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;acquire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;InterruptedException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;semaphore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;AtomicIntegerRunnable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Runnable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AtomicInteger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AtomicInteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;incrementAndGet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I used Runnable to facilitate the testing and timing of the different mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test is made in two phases :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Test with only one thread with a sophisticated benchmark framework. This act also as warmup for the different code.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Test with several threads (several test with increasing number of threads). The test is made using a little code I wrote for the occasion. Each method is executed 2²³ times (8388608 times exactly).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source code is available at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test has been launched on a Ubuntu 10.04 with a Java 6 virtual machine. The computer has a 64 bit Core 2 Duo 3.16 Ghz processor and 6Go of DDR2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's see the results. First with one thread :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Synchronization-benchmark.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-999" title="Synchronization Benchmark - One Thread" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Synchronization-benchmark.png" alt="Synchronization Benchmark - One Thread" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we see is that the AtomicInteger is the fastest version. This is because AtomicInteger do not use waiting operation, so this result in less context switches and more performances. But this is not exactly the case of the benchmark, so let's concentrate on the 5 others methods. We see that the synchronized method is the fastest and that fair methods are a little slower than unfair, but not a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we'll test the scalability of all these methods using several threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Synchronization-2-threads.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1000" title="Synchronization - 2 threads" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Synchronization-2-threads.png" alt="Synchronization - 2 threads" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method we can see that the fair methods are awfully slow compared to the the unfair versions. Indeed adding fairness to a synchronizer is really heavy. When fair, the threads acquire the locks in the order they ask for. With nonfair locks, barging is allowed. So when a thread try to acquire the lock and its available, it can acquire it even if there is threads waiing for the lock. It's heavier to provide fairness because there is a lot more context switches. The problem was not here with only one thread because it's always fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results for the other versions are the same as with one thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's add two more threads :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Synchronization-4-threads.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1001" title="Synchronization - 4 threads" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Synchronization-4-threads.png" alt="Synchronization - 4 threads" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fair versions are more and more slows when we add threads. The scalability of these methods is really bad. Let's see the graph without the fair versions :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Synchronization-4-threads-sub.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1002" title="Synchronization - 4 threads" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Synchronization-4-threads-sub.png" alt="Synchronization - 4 threads" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we can see some differences. The synchronized method is the slower this time and semaphore has a little advantage. Let's see with 8 threads :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Synchronization-8-threads.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1003" title="Synchronization - 8 threads" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Synchronization-8-threads.png" alt="Synchronization - 8 threads" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the synchronized method is really slower than the other methods. It appears that the algorithm of the synchronized block is less scalable than the explicit locks and semaphore versions. Let's watch what happens with other number of threads :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Synchronization-32-threads.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1004" title="Synchronization - 32 threads" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Synchronization-32-threads.png" alt="Synchronization - 32 threads" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Synchronization-128-threads.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1005" title="Synchronization - 128 threads" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Synchronization-128-threads.png" alt="Synchronization - 128 threads" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also made the test with other number of threads (16, 64 and 256), but the results are the same as the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can made several conclusions based on the results :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fair versions are slow. If you don't absolutely need fairness, don't use fair locks or semaphores&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Semaphores and explicit locks have the same performances. This is because the 2 classes (Semaphore and ReentrantLock) are based on the same class AbstractQueueSynchronizer that is used by almost all synchronization mechanisms of Java&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Explicit locks and semaphores are more scalable than synchronized blocks. But that depend on the virtual machine, I've seen other results indicating that the difference is a lot smaller&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The AtomicInteger is the most performing method. This class doesn't provide mutual exclusion, but provide thread safe methods to works on simple values (there is version for Long, Double, Boolean and even Reference)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's all for this benchmark. I hope you found it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sources of the benchmark : &lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/SynchronizationBenchmark.java"&gt;Synchronization Benchmark Sources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Benchmarks</category><category>Concurrency</category><category>Java</category><category>Performances</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2010/09/java-synchronization-mutual-exclusion-benchmark.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2010 05:13:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Java File Copy Benchmark Updates (once again)</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2010/08/file-copy-benchmark-updates-once-again.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've made another updates to my file copy benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I used my &lt;a title="Utility class to create graphs of benchmark results" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/08/generate-graphs-benchmarks-easily/" target="_blank"&gt;little utility class to automatically create the graphs&lt;/a&gt;. The graph are a little less clean, but I spare a lot of time not creating them myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I've also made some corrections on the code :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I''ve used a buffer size of 8192 instead of 4096&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I've made some corrections using the channels because the old code can forgot to write some portions of the file&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I used allocateDirect() instead of allocate() for the ByteBuffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I've added a new method using Java 7 : Path.copyTo(Path path).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the new results are all based on a Java 7 Virtual Machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll find all the new informations and result, on the original post : &lt;a title="Java File Copy Benchmark" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/08/file-copy-in-java-benchmark/" target="_self"&gt;File Copy in Java - Benchmark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this new informations will interest you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Benchmarks</category><category>I/O</category><category>Java</category><category>Java 7</category><category>Performances</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2010/08/file-copy-benchmark-updates-once-again.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2010 05:26:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Generate graphs benchmarks easily</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2010/08/generate-graphs-benchmarks-easily.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After launching a lot of benchmarks for &lt;a title="Java File Copy Benchmark" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/08/file-copy-in-java-benchmark/" target="_blank"&gt;file copy benchmark&lt;/a&gt; and always generating the graphs from the results in Excel, I realized that I was loosing a lot of time to do that. So like any Java developer, I decided to create a little tool that do the work automatically for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For creating benchmarks, I'm using a little micro-benchmarking framework, &lt;a title="How to write correct benchmarks" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/04/write-corrects-benchmarks/" target="_blank"&gt;described here&lt;/a&gt;. After the results are generated, I automatically generate a bar chart of the result using JFreeChart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of graph generated by the tool :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/graph-example.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-931" title="Example graph" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/graph-example.png" alt="Example graph" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Usage of the library&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usage is quite simple. By example, if you want to benchmark two methods :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;method1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Code...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;method2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Code...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Start creating a Benchs :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Benchs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;benchs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Benchs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Title of the benchmark"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;benchs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;setFolder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"folder_path"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;folder_path indicates the folder were the graphs will be generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let’s start the benchs :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;benchs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;bench&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"First method"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Runnable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;method1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;benchs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;bench&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Second method"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Runnable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;method2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;benchs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;generateCharts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The charts will be generated in the specified folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sub chart&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If in the first graph, there is some methods that takes a lot more time than the others methods, a sub chart will be generated including only the best methods. The methods to be removed from the graph to create the sub graph are selected using an exclusion factor. All the benchmarks with a mean exclusionFactor times higher than an other benchmark mean will be excluded. You can configure the exclusion factor using the setExclusionFactor setter. The default is 50.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been asked for new informations about this benchmark and for new test, so I've included more results and informations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new version include two new complete benchmarks :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Benchmark on the same disk (Ext4)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Benchmark between two disks (Ext4 -&amp;gt; Ext4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course the old benchmark is always here : Benchmark between two disks (Ext4 -&amp;gt; NTFS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also included more informations about the disk and the benchmark. The statistics informations about the results are also included in the post. So you can found the standard deviation of the results and the confidence intervals of the results stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And last but not least I've included a new method to copy files using the cp executable of Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are always available at the same place : &lt;a title="File Copy in Java - Benchmark" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/08/file-copy-in-java-benchmark/" target="_self"&gt;File Copy in Java - Benchmark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Benchmarks</category><category>I/O</category><category>Java</category><category>Performances</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2010/08/java-file-copy-benchmarks-update.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2010 07:04:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>File copy in Java - Benchmark</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2010/08/file-copy-in-java-benchmark.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wondered if the copyFile method in JTheque Utils was the best method or if I need to change. So I decided to do a benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I searched all the methods to copy a File in Java, even the bad methods and found 5 methods :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native Copy&lt;/strong&gt; : Make the copy using the cp executable of Linux&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naive Streams Copy&lt;/strong&gt; : Open two streams, one to read, one to write and transfer the content byte by byte.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naive Readers Copy&lt;/strong&gt; : Open two readers, one to read, one to write and transfer the content character by character.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buffered Streams Copy&lt;/strong&gt; : Same as the first but using buffered streams instead of simple streams.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buffered Readers Copy&lt;/strong&gt; : Same as the second but using buffered readers instead of simple readers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Buffer Stream Copy&lt;/strong&gt; : Same as the first but reading the file not byte by byte but using a simple byte array as buffer.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Buffer Reader Copy&lt;/strong&gt; : Same as the fifth but using a Reader instead of a stream.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Buffer Buffered Stream Copy&lt;/strong&gt; : Same as the fifth but using buffered streams.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Buffer Buffered Reader Copy&lt;/strong&gt; : Same as the sixth but using buffered readers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NIO Buffer Copy&lt;/strong&gt; : Using NIO Channel and using a ByteBuffer to make the transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NIO Transfer Copy&lt;/strong&gt; : Using NIO Channel and direct transfer from one channel to other.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Path (Java 7) Copy&lt;/strong&gt; : Using the Path class of Java 7 and its method copyTo()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, this is the principal methods to copy a file to another file. The different methods are available at the end of the post. Pay attention that the methods with Readers only works with text files because Readers are using character by character reading so it doesn't work on a binary file like an image. Here I used a buffer size of 4096 bytes. Of course, use a higher value improve the performances of custom buffer strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the benchmark, I made the tests using different files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Little file (5 KB)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Medium file (50 KB)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Big file (5 MB)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fat file (50 MB)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;And an enormous file (1.3 GB) only binary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I made the tests first using text files and then using binary files. I made the tests using in three modes :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;On the same hard disk. It's an IDE Hard Disk of 250 GB with 8 MB of cache. It's formatted in Ext4.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Between two disk. I used the first disk and an other SATA Hard Disk of 250 GB with 16 MB of cache. It's formatted in Ext4.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Between two disk. I used the first disk and an other SATA Hard Disk of 1 TB with 32 MB of cache. It's formatted using NTFS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a benchmark framework, &lt;a title="Micro-Benchmarking framework" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/04/write-corrects-benchmarks/" target="_blank"&gt;described here&lt;/a&gt;, to make the tests of all the methods. The tests have been made on my personal computer (Ubuntu 10.04 64 bits, Intel Core 2 Duo 3.16 GHz, 6 Go DDR2, SATA Hard Disks). The Java version used is a Java 7 64 bits Virtual Machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've cut the post into several pages due to the length of the post :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Introduction about the benchmark&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Benchmark on the same disk&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Benchmark between Ext4 and Ext4&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Benchmark between Ext4 and NTFS&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Conclusions about the benchmark results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Benchmark on the same disk (Ext4)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's start with the results of the benchmarking using the same disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/little-text-same-disk.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-964" title="Little Text Benchmark Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/little-text-same-disk.png" alt="Little Text Benchmark Results" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that here the native and naive streams methods are a lot slower than the other methods. So lets remove the naive  streams method from the graph to have a better view on the other methods :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/little-text-same-disk-sub.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-965" title="Little Text Benchmark Sub Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/little-text-same-disk-sub.png" alt="Little Text Benchmark Sub Results" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first conclusion we can do is that the naive readers is a lot faster than the naive streams. It's because Reader use a buffer internally and this is not the case in streams. The others methods are closer, so we'll see with the next sizes what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/medium-text-same-disk-sub.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-967" title="Medium Text Benchmark Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/medium-text-same-disk-sub.png" alt="Medium Text Benchmark Results" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we have removed the two naive methods because they are too slows compared to the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The readers methods are slower than the equivalent streams methods because readers are working on chars, so they must make characters conversion for every char of the file, so this is a cost to add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another observation is that the custom buffer strategy is faster than the buffering of the streams and than using custom buffer with a buffered stream or a single stream doesn't change anything. The same observation can be made using the custom buffer using readers, it's the same with buffered readers or not. This is logical, because with custom buffer we made 4096 (size of the buffer) times less invocations to the read method and because we ask for a complete buffer we have not a lot of I/O operations. So the buffer of the streams (or the readers) is not useful here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NIO Buffer, NIO Transfer and Path strategies are almost equivalent to custom buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/big-text-same-disk-sub.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-969" title="Big Text Benchmark Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/big-text-same-disk-sub.png" alt="Big Text Benchmark Results" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see the limits of the simple buffered stream (and readers methods). And another really interesting thing we see is that the native is now faster than buffered streams and readers. Native method must start an external program and this has a cost not negligible. But the copy using the cp executable is really fast and that's because when the file size grows, the native method becomes interesting. All the other methods except the readers are almost equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/fat-text-same-disk.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-970" title="Fat Text Benchmark Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/fat-text-same-disk.png" alt="Fat Text Benchmark Results" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we can see that the native copy method is here as fast as the custom buffer streams. The fast method is the NIO Transfer method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting to see that it doesn't take 100 ms to copy a 50 MB file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll see with binary now. We'll directly start with a 5 MB file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/big-binary-same-disk.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-971" title="Big Binary Benchmark Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/big-binary-same-disk.png" alt="Big Binary Benchmark Results" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see exactly the same results as with a text file. The native method start to be interesting. We see precisely that the NIOand Path methods are really interesting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/fat-binary-same-disk.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-972" title="Fat Binary Benchmark Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/fat-binary-same-disk.png" alt="Fat Binary Benchmark Results" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that all the methods are really, really close, but the native, NIO Buffer, NIO Transfer and Path methods are the best. Just to be sure of these results, let's test with a bigger file :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/enormous-binary-same-disk.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-973" title="Enormous Binary Benchmark Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/enormous-binary-same-disk.png" alt="Enormous Binary Benchmark Results" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we can see that the native method become to be the fastest one. The other method are really close. I thought the NIO Transfer will be normally faster. Due to the size of the file the benchmark has been made only a little number of times, so the number can be inaccurate. We see that he Path method is really close to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detailed informations (standard deviation, confidence intervals and other stats stuff) are available in the conclusion page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Benchmark between two disks (Ext4 -&amp;gt; Ext4)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the results of the same tests but using two hard disk with the same formatting (Ext4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/little-text-same-disk1.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-975" title="Little Text Benchmark Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/little-text-same-disk1.png" alt="Little Text Benchmark Results" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see exactly the same results as in the first benchmark. The naive streams iscompletely useless for little files. So let's remove itand see what happens for interesting methods :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/little-text-between-disks-sub.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-976" title="Little Text Benchmark Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/little-text-between-disks-sub.png" alt="Little Text Benchmark Results" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here again, the conclusion are the same and the times are not enough big to make global conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/medium-text-between-disks-sub.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-977" title="Medium Text Benchmark Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/medium-text-between-disks-sub.png" alt="Medium Text Benchmark Results" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we have the limits of the buffered strategy and see a real advantage of custom buffer strategy. We also see that the NIO Transfer and Path methods are taking a little advantage. But again, the times are really short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/big-text-between-disks-sub.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-978" title="Big Text Benchmark Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/big-text-between-disks-sub.png" alt="Big Text Benchmark Results" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see the reintroduction of the native method on the interesting methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/fat-text-between-disks.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-979" title="Fat Text Benchmark Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/fat-text-between-disks.png" alt="Fat Text Benchmark Results" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we covered the text files. If we compare the times between the first benchmark (the same disk) and this method (between two disk), we can see that the times are almost the same, just a little slower for some methods. So let's watch the big binary files :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/fat-binary-between-disks.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-980" title="Fat Binary Benchmark Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/fat-binary-between-disks.png" alt="Fat Binary Benchmark Results" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the results are close to using the same disk. So let's see with the last file :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/enormous-binary-between-disks.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-981" title="Enormous Binary Benchmark Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/enormous-binary-between-disks.png" alt="Enormous Binary Benchmark Results" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, the differences are impressive. The native and NIO Buffer methods are the fastest methods. The NIO Transfer is a little slower but the Path method is a lot slower here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transfer is a lot faster than on the same disk. I'm not sure of the cause of these results. The only reason I can found is that the operating system can made the two things at the same time, reading on the first disk and writing on the second disk. If someone has a better conclusion, don't hesitate to comment the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detailed informations (standard deviation, confidence intervals and other stats stuff) are available in the conclusion page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Benchmark between two disks (Ext4 -&amp;gt; NTFS)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the results of the first version of this post. The first disk is always the same, but the second disk is a NTFS. For concision, I removed some graphes. I've also removed the conclusion that are the same as the first two benchmarks. The native method is not covered in these results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/little-text-file-2.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-876" title="Little Text File - Best results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/little-text-file-2.png" alt="Little Text File - Best results" width="483" height="411"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best two versions are the Buffered Streams and Buffered Readers. Here this is because the buffered streams and readers can write the file in only one operation. Here the times are in microseconds, so there is really little differences between the methods. So the results are not really relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's test with a bigger file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/medium-text-file.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-877" title="Medium Text File" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/medium-text-file.png" alt="Medium Text File" width="488" height="371"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that the versions with the Readers are a little slower than the version with the streams. This is because Readers works on character and for every read() operation, a char conversion must be made, and the same conversion must be made on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another observation is that the custom buffer strategy is faster than the buffering of the streams and than using custom buffer with a buffered stream or a single stream doesn't change anything. The same observation can be made using the custom buffer using readers, it's the same with buffered readers or not. This is logical, because with custom buffer we made 4096 (size of the buffer) times less invocations to the read method and because we ask for a complete buffer we have not a lot of I/O operations. So the buffer of the streams (or the readers) is not useful here. The NIO buffer strategy is almost equivalent to custom buffer. And the direct transfer using NIO is here slower than the custom buffer methods. I think this is because here the cost of invoking native methods in the operating system level is higher than simply the cost of making the file copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/big-text-file-2.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-879" title="Big Text File - Best results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/big-text-file-2.png" alt="Big Text File - Best results" width="483" height="391"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, it's now clear that the custom buffer strategy is a better than the simple buffered streams or readers and that using custom buffer and buffered streams is really useful for bigger files. The Custom Buffer Readers method is better than Custom Buffer Streams because FileReader use a buffer internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, continue with a bigger file :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/fat-text-file.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-880" title="Fat Text File Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/fat-text-file.png" alt="Fat Text File Results" width="483" height="392"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that it doesn't take 500 ms to copy a 50 MB file using the custom buffer strategy and that it even doesn't take 400 ms with the NIO Transfer method. Really quick isn't it ? We can see that for a big file, the NIO Transfer start to show an advantage, we'll better see that in the binary file benchmarks. We will directly start with a big file (5 MB) for this benchmark :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/big-binary-file.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-881" title="Big Binary File Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/big-binary-file.png" alt="Big Binary File Results" width="483" height="291"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can make the same conclusion as for the text files, of course, the buffered streams methods is not fast. The other methods are really close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/fat-binary-file.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-883" title="Fat Binary File Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/fat-binary-file.png" alt="Fat Binary File Results" width="483" height="291"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see here again that the NIO Transfer is gaining advantages more the files is bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just for the pleasure, a great file (1.3 GB) :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/enormous-binary-file.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-882" title="Enormous Binary File Results" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/enormous-binary-file.png" alt="Enormous Binary File Results" width="483" height="291"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that all the methods are really close, but the NIO Transfer method has an advantage of 500 ms. It's not negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conclusion we can make is that transfering a file from Ext4 to Ext4 is a lot faster than from Ext4 to NTFS. I think it's logical because the operating system must made conversions. I think it's not because of the disk, because the NTFS disk is the faster I've.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the NIO Transfer method is the best one for big files but it's not the fastest for little files (&amp;lt; 5 MB). But the custom buffer strategy (and the NIO Buffer too) are also really fast methods to copy files. We've also see that the method using the native utility tools to make the copy is faster as NIO for big files (&amp;lt; 1 GB) but it's really slow for little files because of the cost of invoking an external program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So perhaps, the best method is a method that make a custom buffer strategy on the little files and a NIO Transfer on the big ones and perhaps use the native executable on the really bigger ones. But it will be interesting to also make the tests on an other computer and operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can take several rules from this benchmark :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Never made a copy of file byte by byte (or char by char)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Prefer a buffer in your side more than in the stream to make less invocations of the read method, but don't forget the buffer in the side of the streams&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pay attention to the size of the buffers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Don't use char conversion if you only need to tranfer the content of a file, so don't use Reader if you need only streams.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Don't hesitate to use channels to make file transfer, it's the fastest way to make a file transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Consider the native executable invocation only for really bigger files.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The new Path method of Java 7 is really fast except for the transfer of an enormous file between two disks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this benchmark (and its results) interested you.&lt;/p&gt;

In this article I'll explain an efficient algorithm using plane sweep, compare it to the naive implementation and discuss its complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem is standard, but not really easy to solve in an efficient way. The first implementation we think of is the naive one, comparing each point to each other point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my examples, I'll use the java.awt.Point class to represent a point. This naive implementation is really easy to implement :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;naiveClosestPair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;points&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;MAX_VALUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;closestPair&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;points&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;points&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="kt"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;distance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;closestPair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;closestPair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;closestPair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can directly see, this naive implementation has a complexity of O(n^2). But we can do a lot better using a plane sweep algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that algorithm, we'll sweep the plane from left to right (right to left is also a possibility) and when we reach a point we'll compute all the interesting candidates (the candidates that can be in the closest pair).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that we'll make the following operations :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We sort the list of points from left to right in the x axis&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;And then for each point :
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We remove from the candidates all the point that are further in x axis that the current min distance&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We take all the candidates that are located more or less current min distance from the current point in y axis&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We test for the min distance all the founded candidates with the current point&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;And finally we add the current point to the list of candidates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when we found a new min distance, we can make the rectangle of candidates smaller in the x axis and smaller in the y axis. So we made a lot less comparisons between the points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture illustrating that :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Sweep.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-473" title="Plane Sweep Algorithm" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Sweep.png" alt="Plane Sweep Algorithm" width="500" height="436"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red points are the closest pair at this time of the algorithm. The red rectangle is the rectangle of the candidates delimited in right by the current point. And the yellow rectangle contains only the candidates interesting for the current point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always a maximum of 6 points in the yellow rectangle, the 4 vertices, the point with the same coordinates as the current point and finally the point in the same y coordinate and in the limit of the x axis. Even if the maximum is 6, you'll almost never have more than 2 points in that list (the maximum is see in my test was 3 with a collection of 1'000'000 random points). You can see this 6 points here :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Sweep-points.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-474" title="Maximum points to compare" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Sweep-points.png" alt="Maximum points to compare" width="132" height="232"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all that stuff is not really clear for you, you can watch it in action here &lt;a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~cs251/ClosestPair/ClosestPairApplet/ClosestPairApplet.html" target="_blank"&gt;in a Java applet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The candidates must also be always sorted. For that, we'll use a Binary Search Tree for good performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the complexity :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Sorting all the points in right axis : Cost O(n ln n) with Quick Sort by example&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Shrinking the list of candidates take O(n) from start to end of the algorithm because we add n points to the candidates and we can remove only n points. So this is constant for each point : O(1).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Searching all the candidates between two values in y axis cost O(ln n) with binary search&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The comparisons with at maximum 6 points are made in O(1)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Add the candidates and keep the list of candidates sorted cost O(ln n).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the total complexity is O(n ln(n) + n * ( 1 + ln(n) + 1 + ln(n) ) ) = O(n ln n).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's really better than O(n^2) for the naive implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, we can go to the implementation in Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;closestPair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;points&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;closestPair&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//When we start the min distance is the infinity&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;crtMinDist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;POSITIVE_INFINITY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Get the points and sort them&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sorted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Arrays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;copyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;points&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;points&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Arrays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;HORIZONTAL_COMPARATOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//When we start the left most candidate is the first one&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;leftMostCandidateIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Vertically sorted set of candidates&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;SortedSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;candidates&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TreeSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;VERTICAL_COMPARATOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="n"&gt;candidates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;leftMostCandidateIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//We take only the interesting candidates in the y axis&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;candidates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;subSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kt"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;distance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;distance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Simple min computation&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;distance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;crtMinDist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;crtMinDist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;distance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="n"&gt;closestPair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;closestPair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//The current point is now a candidate&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;candidates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;closestPair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The code isn't overcomplicated. We see all the steps explained in the article and that works well. The Horizontal and Vertical comparators are really simple : &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Comparator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;VERTICAL_COMPARATOR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Comparator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;compare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Comparator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;HORIZONTAL_COMPARATOR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Comparator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is a performance comparison for some sizes with &lt;a href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/04/write-corrects-benchmarks/" target="_blank"&gt;a Benchmark Framework I described here&lt;/a&gt; for some sizes of collection points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="55" valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="91" valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="87" valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweeping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="55" valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="91" valign="top"&gt;189.923 us&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="87" valign="top"&gt;53.685 us&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="55" valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;500&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="91" valign="top"&gt;4.448 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="87" valign="top"&gt;279.042 us&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="55" valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="91" valign="top"&gt;17.790 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="87" valign="top"&gt;556.731 us&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="55" valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="91" valign="top"&gt;458.728 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="87" valign="top"&gt;3.320 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like you can see, this is really better than the naive implementation. So we make a good job. But if we make one more test with 10 elements :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="55" valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="91" valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="87" valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweeping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="55" valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="91" valign="top"&gt;1.932 us&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="87" valign="top"&gt;4.746 us&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now our good sweeping algorithm is slower than the naive !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think about that, we realize that it's logical. In fact we made a lot of computations before starting the algorithm like sorting the points, creating a list of candidantes, ... All that stuff is heavier than make n^2 comparisons in little number. So what can we do to have good performances with small number of points ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really easy to solve. We just have to found the number before which the naive algorithm is quicker than the sweeping and when the size of the points collection is smaller than this pivot number we use the naive implementation. On my computer I found that before 75 elements, the naive implementation was faster than the sweeping algorithm, so we can refactor our method :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;closestPair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;points&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;points&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;75&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;naiveClosestPair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;points&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//No changes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And we've good performances for little set of points :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So our method is now complete.

I wrote that code to achieve my goal :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;wicht&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;old&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;startTime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;nanoTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="n"&gt;resultShort&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Temp pour short : "&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;nanoTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;startTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;" ms"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resultInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resultShort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And i found as a result that short was two times slower than int and I was convinced of these results until a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, a reader (Jean) criticized the results of my tests and gave me links to several articles about &lt;strong&gt;micro-benchmarking&lt;/strong&gt;. I've read these articles and understand why my results were incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, my test doesn't pay attention to several things that can change results of tests :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JVM warmup&lt;/strong&gt; : Due to several parameters, the code is first often slow and becomes faster and faster when the execution time grows until it goes to steady-state.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class loading&lt;/strong&gt; : The first time you launch a benchmark, all the used classes must be loaded, increasing the execution time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just In Time Compiler&lt;/strong&gt; : When the JVM identify a hot part of the code&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garbage Collector&lt;/strong&gt; : A garbage collection can happen during the benchmark and with that the time can increase a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to all these factors, the first runs (perhaps 10 seconds of run) are slower than the other and than can make your benchmarks completely false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how can we do to have good benchmarks results ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really difficult, but we can have help using a benchmark framework introduced by Brent Boyer, a software developer from Elliptic Group. This framework take care of all the previously introduced factors and made good benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of this framework is really simple, you just have to create a new instance of the Benchmark class passing to it a Callable or a Runnable and the test is directly launched. Here is the example with the test of short and int in loop indexes :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShortIndexesLoop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;Callable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;callableInt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Callable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="kt"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;amp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;32760&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++){&lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;444&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="kt"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To get the results, you can use Benchmark.toString() or Benchmark.toStringFull() for more statistics. You can also directly access some stats like standard deviation using Benchmark.getSd() or directly with Benchmark.getStats() to get all the stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the result with the preceding code :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Result int
first = 807.056 us, mean = 46.032 us (CI deltas: -261.393 ns, +408.932 ns), sd = 230.929 us (CI deltas: -68.201 us, +105.262 us)
Result short
first = 721.912 us, mean = 48.234 us (CI deltas: -198.625 ns, +254.774 ns), sd = 160.196 us (CI deltas: -32.764 us, +37.882 us)&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the short version is only 104.78% slower than the int. That show that the first results were completely false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the full results of the int version :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like you can perhaps see when you use this framework, it gives you some warnings when by example you have extreme outliers that can make the standard deviation completely false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download this framework on &lt;a href="http://www.ellipticgroup.com/html/benchmarkingArticle.html"&gt;the web page of the Elliptic Group&lt;/a&gt;. I found it really powerful and easy to use and I'll use it everytime I have to do a benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I must also say that even if you use that kind of framework, you can make very bad benchmarks if you don't test the right part of the code. Here are two really interesting articles from Brent Boyer :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first view, it can be tempting because we save 2 octets, so why use an int instead a short ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, when we think of that, we see that the int is more adapted. Indeed, it's more performant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Java language, all the operations on integers are made in int. Thus, if we use a short as loop index, at each iterations, a typecasting will be made, that's really heavier than a simple affectation to int.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here were my first results :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Time for int : 1441 ms
Time for short : 3015 ms&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short version is two times slower !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like Jean have said, my first test was not correct at all because it doesn't consider some issues that could occurs with micro-benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I write a new test using a Java Benchmarking framework from Brent Boyer. Here is a little test with that framework :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;wicht&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;bb.util.Benchmark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;java.util.concurrent.Callable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShortIndexesLoop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;Callable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;callableInt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Callable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="kt"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;amp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;32760&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++){&lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;Callable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;callableShort&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Callable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="kt"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;amp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;32760&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++){&lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Result with int "&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Benchmark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;callableInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Result with short "&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Benchmark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;callableShort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;printStackTrace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And here are the results :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Result with int first = 695.181 us, mean = 43.233 us (CI deltas: -49.358 ns, +74.073 ns), sd = 42.938 us (CI deltas: -11.634 us, +16.426 us)
Result with short first = 733.224 us, mean = 45.679 us (CI deltas: -62.975 ns, +63.932 ns), sd = 45.567 us (CI deltas: -5.877 us, +8.020 us)&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the results are lower. This time, the short version is 5.657% slower than the int version. Note that this can vary a lot depending on your configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talk here of for loops, but the case is the same when you use while loops with indexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are also the results with long, double and float versions :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Result with long first = 816.555 us, mean = 104.771 us (CI deltas: -236.563 ns, +344.219 ns), sd = 143.295 us (CI deltas: -39.149 us, +63.700 us)
Result with float first = 1.018 ms, mean = 58.055 us (CI deltas: -87.036 ns, +113.537 ns), sd = 70.757 us (CI deltas: -14.269 us, +19.962 us)
Result with double first = 912.115 us, mean = 57.918 us (CI deltas: -66.644 ns, +91.312 ns), sd = 55.185 us (CI deltas: -12.617 us, +25.160 us)&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that the long version is the slowest one and that float and double are equivalent but slower than int and short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, always use int as loop indexes add a very little improvements of performances, but not a great thing and do not use long for loops indexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Benchmarks</category><category>Java</category><category>Performances</category><category>Tips</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2010/01/dont-use-shorts-in-loop.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jan 2010 14:12:33 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
