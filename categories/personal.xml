Nikola is a static site generator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reasons of the migration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had several reasons to migrate my website from WordPress to a static site generator: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was getting tired of WordPress. It not a bad tool, but it is becoming heavier and heavier. I think that one of the biggest problems is that you need tons of plugins to make a fully-functional blog. I had more than 20 plugins. And each time you upgrade WordPress, you run into problems with the addons. In my opinion, while I understand why you need plugins for syntax highlighting for instance, you should not need any plugin for performances or security. Moreover, when you think of it a blog is not dynamic, I write less than a post a week and most bloggers write about once a day, in the computer science's sense, it is not dynamic at all. So why bother with a database ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to use my favourite tools for modifying my blog: the shell and vim. I don't think that wysiwyg editors are really adding any value to editing. I am faster writing posts in vim than I'm in a web editor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to be able to edit my website offline. With a static generator, as long as you have the files on your computer, you can edit your site and even browse it offline. You can then deploy it on the internet later when you are online. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to host my blog at Github Pages, for fun! Moreover, I had some uptime issues with my host with quite some downtime in the last months. And it saves me some bucks each year, at least it was not a strong factor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The quest for a good static blog generator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been several months already since I started thinking about migrating my blog. I had quite a hard time to find a suitable blog generator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed something: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completely usable in command line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a WordPress import feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast: I didn't wanted to spend a long time generating the website. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actively developed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that there are tens of static site generator. I considered several of them. The most well known is Jekyll. It really looks fine, but I have to say that I HATE Ruby. I think it is an horrible language with an even more horrible environment. I cannot even have Ruby installed on my computer. So I didn't spend a long time considering Jekyll. I also considered Hyde, which is the evil brother of Jekyll, but I think that it was missing documentation to be completely usable for me. I also though of Pelican, but I was not convinced with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how, but at first I didn't found about Nikola. It was only after some time that I came across Nikola by pure luck. Once I came accross Nikola, I directly was convinced by it. Nikola is written in Python and has a large set of features but still keeps the whole think very simple. Generation of the website is pretty fast. Even though I don't like Python very much, I'm able to stand its environment and if necessary I can hack around a bit. I also considered Hyde, which is the evil brother of Jekyll, but I think that it was missing documentation to be completely usable for me. I also though of Pelican, but I was not convinced with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how, but at first I didn't found about Nikola. It was only after some time that I came across Nikola by pure luck. Once I found about Nikola, I directly was convinced by it. Nikola is written in Python and has a large set of features but still keeps the whole think very simple. Generation of the website is pretty fast. Even though I don't like Python very much, I'm able to stand its environment and if necessary I can hack around a bit. So I decided to try the complete migration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The migration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I decided to migrate to Nikola, I directly started by importing my WordPress site into a Git repository. This process is quite simple, you just have to export and XML dump from WordPress and then import it into Nikola with the *import_wordpress" command. This already downloads the necessary images and resources and create posts and pages corresponding to your site. It also generates some redirections from the old URL scheme to the new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is still some manual work to be done. Here is what I had to do after I imported my WordPress site into Nikola: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As syntax highlighting was done by a plugin, I had to convert it to Markdown myself. This was quite easy, just a matter of &lt;em&gt;sed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was not satisfied with the default templates so I enhanced it myself. As I'm a very poor web developer and even poorer web designer, it took me a long time, even if it is a simple one. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to add some visibility to the comments, so I used Disqus API to create Most Popular and Recent Comments widgets. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had to create some redirections by myself for the tags and categories. This was again just a matter of simple shell commands. I filled a bug about it so it'll probably be fixed in the near future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried to improve the performances of the generated website, but I'm still gonna work on this later, the calls to Disqus and Google javascripts are the ones that takes the most of the load time. I think that a static site could be even faster. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, I really missed the options to have related posts generated for each posts, so I hacked a simple way to include them for each posts. The related posts are generated using a very simple algorithm. I'll soon write a post about how I have done this. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except from these things, it hasn't been too hard to migrate to Nikola. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now I'm really satisfied with Nikola and I hope this will motivate me to write more blog posts in the coming months. I hope you'll find the website as enjoyable as before (or even more :) ). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I tried my best to avoid 404 or problems with the new site, I'm pretty sure there will be some issues in the following weeks. If you happen to found a dead link or some part of the website is not working for you, don't hesitate to comment this post and I'll my best to fix it. If you have suggestions on how to improve the site or have a question about the process of migrating a website from Wordpress to Nikola, I'd be glad to answer you. &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Nikola</category><category>Personal</category><category>The site</category><category>WordPress</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2014/03/migrated-from-wordpress-to-nikola.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2014 21:23:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Why and how I completely left Windows for Linux</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2013/07/why-how-left-windows-for-linux.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;For years now, I always kept a dual-boot at home with a Linux system (currently Gentoo) and a Windows system. At work, I only use Gentoo. This week-end, I decided to completely remove it and migrate the applications I used on Windows to my Gentoo system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why Windows ?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first things first, why was I keeping the Windows system ? For several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Games :) Unfortunately, most of the games I play are not natively compatible with Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Office. I always liked Microsoft Office. As I hate OpenOffice/LibreOffice, I never wanted to remove it For schools we always had several teachers forcing us to use Microsoft document formats.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Hardware support. I always found that hardware support in Windows was great. Most of the time when you add new peripheral, there is nothing, it just works, which is great.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Applications. I always had some applications that I didn't found good enough Linux equivalents for. For instance, Newsleecher, iTunes or TaggedFrog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I work on Linux for years now and I would like to have to work on Windows again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What Changed ?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend I upgraded my hardware configuration (Motherboard, CPU and RAM). I was afraid that I had to reinstall my Linux configurations (because of Gentoo compiled with march=native), but I never thought that I would have to reinstall Windows. I turned out the contrary: my Gentoo installation worked just fine and my Windows totally crashed (BSOD at each startup). I finally made it through Windows after disabled AHCI mode on my motherboard, but then activation was invalidated (of course...) and online activation was not working. I decided to install the new chipset drivers and launch the Windows update and after that, Windows decided to boot without any USB support (WTF...). After that, I decided that Windows what not so great at all for   hardware support...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason I left Windows is Windows 8. I find that Window 7 was really great, but I really don't like Windows 8 and I would never have upgraded my Seven to it. Moreover, I recently bought Microsoft Office 2013 and it turned that I had to create an account at Microsoft to install it... Seriously ??? And moreover, it turned out to be worse thant Office 2010 (which, again, was great).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all these reasons made me remove Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to migrate everything to Linux ?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I had no problem with my data. Most of my data are on a personal NAS and the remaining is on Dropbox, so no problem on this side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still had some problems to resolve. First of all, I needed my games to run on Linux. I currently play only Diablo III. As I had received a year free of &lt;a title="Crossover" href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/"&gt;Crossover&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to give it a try. Crossover is based on Wine and ensures that some software are running correctly under it and provide technical support. After some tuning, Diablo III was running almost flawlessly on my Gentoo machine :) Problem 1 solved. I will totally buy a license of Crossover, once my free year is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still add some applications to replace. I use iTunes as my main music player and library manager. Some time ago, I tried a lot of programs like Amarok/Rythmbox/Banshee, but I didn't liked them a lot and they were not running very well on large library of music files. This time, I tried &lt;a title="Clementine" href="http://www.clementine-player.org/"&gt;Clementine&lt;/a&gt;. Even if not very beautiful, it had all the features I needed and worked very well. I decided to stick with it. Another program I like a lot on Windows is TaggedFrog. It is a very simple program allowing to put tags on any file on the system and then search by tag on them. I haven't found a total equivalent. I first tried Tracker that is a Gnome project, but I was not satisfied with the search interface. After that, I tried the very simple &lt;a title="TMSU" href="http://tmsu.org/"&gt;TMSU&lt;/a&gt;. It is a command-line based tagging manager. All the tagging must be done in command line. In my case, it is not a problem, as I don't mind using the command-line and I don't tag files very often. What is very interesting about TMSU is that it can create a virtual file system (based on FUSE). In this file system, you have all your tags  as folder and you can see directly all the files of each tag. Moreover, you can directly make cross search (has tag X and Y and Z) by just going down in the tag folder. It is really great and has everything I needed. Finally, I also needed something to replace Newsleecher. I haven't found something as great (especially no replacement for the Supersearch function), but I installed &lt;a title="Sabnzbd" href="http://sabnzbd.org/"&gt;Sabnzbd&lt;/a&gt; which works really well and is very simple. For now, I just use the web interface and haven't installed any other front-end, but that will perhaps change in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't replaced Office for now on. It occurred to me that since I left school, I haven't used it a lot, so that will probably not be a problem anymore. I will change to write the few letters I have to write on Latex and if I have Office documents, I'll probably read them on Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I lost a lot of time with all that, I think it is a great think. It makes one less configuration to maintain and some less costs on the future. Moreover, I will save some time, because I won't have to switch between Linux and Windows for different tasks. And now, I have a second SSD ready for something else, either for RAID 1 to ensure redundancy on Linux or to mount on a server, I'll see later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will probably have some more problems in the future, but I'm convinced that there will be Linux solutions to it :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Gentoo</category><category>Linux</category><category>Others</category><category>Personal</category><category>Windows</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2013/07/why-how-left-windows-for-linux.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 06:24:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Back in Berkeley, California</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2012/09/back-in-berkeley-california.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I arrived yesterday to Berkeley, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like I did my Bachelor thesis in Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), I will do my Master Thesis there too. The thesis will last a bit less than a semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my Master Thesis I will try to use profiling samples from the Linux perf tools in GCC or Clang to optimize processor cache usage (avoid cache and page faults).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to publish some posts about that during the semester if I have time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Compilers</category><category>Others</category><category>Personal</category><category>The site</category><category>gcc</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2012/09/back-in-berkeley-california.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2012 08:35:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Merry Christmas</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2011/12/merry-christmas.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;A bit late, but better late than never : Merry Christmas to all the readers of this blog :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Others</category><category>Personal</category><category>The site</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2011/12/merry-christmas.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2011 00:12:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New Wordpress theme for the site</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2011/11/new-theme-site.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;After a long time with the old F2 theme, I decided to choose a more modern design. I chose the WP Plus design which is based on the Google Plus Design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that this design is more practical and cleaner for the users and more comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I also took some time to change some of my addons. I replaced All In One SEO with Wordpress SEO plugin from Joost de Valk. I think that this plugin is better than the first one, but more of that, it also replaced one addon generating the XML sitemap and helped me adding a breadcrumb to the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that these changes will improve the user experience on my website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you encounter any kind of problems with the new design, don't hesitate to let a comment or to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Personal</category><category>The site</category><category>Web</category><category>WordPress</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2011/11/new-theme-site.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2011 00:56:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Diploma Thesis : Inlining Assistance for large-scale object-oriented applications</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2011/10/diploma-thesis-inlining-assistance-for-large-scale-object-oriented-applications.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;One month ago, my diploma thesis has been accepted and I got my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made my diploma thesis at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California. I was in the team responsible of the developmenet of the ATLAS Software for the LHC in Cern. The title of my thesis is &lt;strong&gt;Inlining Assistance for large-scale object-oriented applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project was to create a C++ analyzer to find the best functions and call sites to inline. The input of the analyzer is a call graph generated by CallGrind of the Valgrind project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functions and call sites to inline are computed using a heuristic, called the temperature. This heuristic is based on the cost of calling the given function, the frequency of calls and the size of the function. The cost of calling a function is based on the number of parameters, the virtuality of the function and the shared object the function is located in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analyzer is also able to find clusters of call sites. A cluster is a set of hot call sites related to each other. It can also finds the functions that should be moved from one library to the other or the function that should not be virtual by testing the use of each function in a class hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this project, it has been necessary to study in details how a function is called on the Linux platform. The inlining optimization has also been studied to know what were the advantages and the problems of this technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To retrieve the information about the sizes and the virtuality of the function, it has been necessary to read the shared libraries and executables files. For that, we used &lt;em&gt;libelf&lt;/em&gt;. The virtuality of a function is calculated by reading each virtual table and searching for the function in the virtual tables content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graph manipulation is made by the &lt;em&gt;Boost Graph Library&lt;/em&gt;. As it was an advanced library, it has helped me improving my skills in specific topics like templates, traits or Template Metaprogramming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analyzer is able to run on the Linux platform on any program that has been compiled using gcc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you have perhaps noticed, there is no more Google Adsense on the site. I removed them for several reasons :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;They were not really visually good&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;They slowed down the site by a factor of two&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;That gave a bad image of the site&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This is not the main goal of the website to make money&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;They didn't made enough money to counter the previous disadvantages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you will now have a faster and a bit nicer website to look at :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only page that contains ads on the site is the search because of the use of Google Custom Search that includes Google Ads, but this is not my ads. I will perhaps consider to add another search system in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this will make the site more enjoyable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Is there is still a page with ads that I have forgotten to update, just let a comment with the URL of the page and I will remove the ads&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Google</category><category>Personal</category><category>The site</category><category>Web</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2011/06/no-more-ads-on-the-site.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2011 06:33:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Now writing from Berkeley, California</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2011/05/now-writing-from-berkeley-california.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This message has been written from California, where I'm for 3 months. I'm making my bachelor final project in Berkeley Labs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll certainly give some informations about the project and my researches during the next months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that I'll have the time to write more articles this next months as I've made the last months... I had a lot of work at school and no motivation to write.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Others</category><category>Personal</category><category>The site</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2011/05/now-writing-from-berkeley-california.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 May 2011 20:38:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Save time with the Gmail Priority Inbox</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2010/09/save-time-with-the-gmail-priority-inbox.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Some days ago, Gmail released a new feature, the &lt;strong&gt;Priority Inbox&lt;/strong&gt;. Actually, the feature is not released on all accounts, but if it is released on yours, you can see a message "Try Gmail Priority Inbox", in top right high corner, just after your user name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you activated this new inbox, you will see two inbox, the new Priority Inbox on top and the old Inbox. The Inbox has not changed, but now you can use the Priority Inbox. In this view, you will see your messages sorted in two categories, the first one contains the important unread messages and the second one contains all the other messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you found an error, namely a non-important message tagged as important or the contrary, you have two new buttons :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Gmail-Buttons.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1018" title="GMail Priority Buttons" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Gmail-Buttons.png" alt="GMail Priority Buttons" width="77" height="32"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these buttons, you can move a message from the priority messages to the others and vice versa. When you do that, the algorithm between the sorting will save your action and try to improve the efficiency of the Priority Inbox to not make the same error again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, I'm completely happy with this new feature, I've had only one message marked as important that was not, but it's all. I think it's a great tool that Google has offerred to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed the exam with 93%. I'm really happy of my score. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prepare this exam, I read the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/SCJP-Certified-Programmer-Java-310-065/dp/0071591060/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1270728614&amp;amp;sr=1-2"&gt;SCJP Sun Certified Programmer for Java 6 Exam 310-065&lt;/a&gt; and exercise the chapters for which I wasn't good enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So i started my exam this morning at 8.30 (Switzerland time) and after 2 hours of work, I was happy to see my score and to rest my poor brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now i'm waiting of the certificate sended by post.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Java</category><category>Personal</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2010/04/passed-scjp-exam.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2010 06:14:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Welcome to my new website !</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2010/03/welcome-to-my-new-website.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my new english website :)&lt;/p&gt;
