&lt;p&gt;I'm very happy to announce the release of the first version of Deep Learning
Library (DLL) 1.0. DLL is a neural network library with a focus on speed and
ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started working on this library about 4 years ago for my Ph.D. thesis.
I needed a good library to train and use Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)
and at this time there was no good support for it. Therefore, I decided to write
my own. It now has very complete support for the RBM and the Convolutional RBM
(CRBM) models. Stacks of RBMs (or Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)) can be pretrained
using Contrastive Divergence and then either fine-tuned with mini-batch gradient
descent or Conjugate Gradient or used as a feature extractor. Over the years,
the library has been extended to handle Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The network is also able to train regular
auto-encoders. Several advanced layers such as Dropout or Batch Normalization
are also available as well as adaptive learning rates techniques such as
Adadelta and Adam. The library also has integrated support for a few datasets:
MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This library can be used using a C++ interface. The library is fully
header-only. It requires a C++14 compiler, which means a minimum of clang 3.9 or
GCC 6.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I'm going to present a few examples on using the library and give
some information about the performance of the library and the roadmap for the
project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm happy to announce the version 1.2 of my Expression Templates Library (ETL):
ETL 1.2, two months after &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/08/expression-templates-library-etl-11.html"&gt;I released the version 1.1&lt;/a&gt;.
This version features much better GPU Support, a few new features and a lot of
changes in the internal code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="gpu-support"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GPU Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before, only algorithms such as 4D convolution or matrix-matrix multiplication
were computed in the GPU and lots of operations were causing copies between CPU
and GPU version. Now, the support for basic operations has also been completed
and therefore, expressions like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code cpp"&gt;&lt;a name="rest_code_e97eaba5087f47d0aee5f7ce1c6431bc-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sigmoid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can be computed entirely on GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each matrix and vector containers have a secondary GPU memory space.  During the
execution, the status of both memory spaces is being managed and when necessary,
copies are made between two spaces. In the best case, there should only be
initial copies to the GPU and then everything should be done on the GPU. I've
also considered using Unified Memory in place of this system, but this is
a problem for fast matrix and I'd rather not have two different systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an expression such as &lt;code&gt;c = a + b * 2&lt;/code&gt;, it can be entirely computed
on GPU, however, it will be computed in two GPU operations such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code cpp"&gt;&lt;a name="rest_code_850c1f8548ae4ab89679a31d2e62b2d6-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name="rest_code_850c1f8548ae4ab89679a31d2e62b2d6-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not perfect in terms of performance but this will be done without any
copies between CPU and GPU memory. I plan to improve this system with a bit more
complex operations to avoid too many GPU operations, but there will always be
more operations than in CPU where this can easily be done in one go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few expressions that are not computable on the GPU, such as random
generations. A few transformations are also not fully compatible with GPU.
Moreover, if you access an element with operators &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, this
will invalidate the GPU memory and force an update to the CPU memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPU operations are not implemented directly in ETL, there are coming from
various libraries. ETL is using NVIDIA CUDNN, CUFFT and CUDNN for most
algorithms. Moreover, for other operations, I've implemented a libraries with
simple GPU operations: ETL-GPU-BLAS (EGBLAS). You can have a look at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl-gpu-blas"&gt;egblas&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Deep Learning Library (DLL) project is based on ETL and its performances are
mostly dependent on ETL's performances. Now that ETL fully supports GPU, the
GPU performance of DLL is much improved. You may remember a few weeks ago
I posted &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/08/dll-blazing-fast-neural-network-library.html"&gt;very high CPU performance of DLL&lt;/a&gt;.
Now, I've run again the tests to see the GPU performance with DLL. Here is the
performance for training a small CNN on the MNIST data set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Performances for training a Convolutional Neural Network on MNIST" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/etl_12_dll_gpu_mnist.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the performances on GPU are now excellent. DLL's performances
are on par with Tensorflow and Keras!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next results are for training a much larger CNN on ImageNet, with the time
necessary to train a single batch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Performances for training a Convolutional Neural Network on Imagenet" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/etl_12_dll_gpu_imagenet.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, using the new version of ETL inside DLL has led to excellent performance.
The framework is again on par with TensorFlow and Keras and faster than all the
other frameworks. The large difference between DLL and Tensorflow and Keras is
due to the inefficiency of reading the dataset in the two frameworks, so the
performance of the three framework themselves are about the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-changes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library also has a few other new features. Logarithms of base 2 and base 10
are now supported in complement to the base e that was already available before.
Categorical Cross Entropy (CCE) computation is also available now, the CCE loss
and error can be computed for one or many samples. Convolutions have also been
improved in that you can use mixed types in both the image and the kernel and
different storage order as well. Nevertheless, the most optimized version
remains the version with the same storage order and the same data type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also made a major change in the way implementations are selected for each
operation. The tests and the benchmark are using a system to force the selection
of an algorithm. This system is now disabled by default. This makes the
compilation much faster by default. Since it's not necessary in most cases, this
will help regular use cases of the library by compiling much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the support for complex numbers has been improved in ETL. There are
more routines that are supported and &lt;code&gt;etl::complex&lt;/code&gt; is better supported
throughout the code. I'll still work on this in the future to make it totally
complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal code also has a few new changes. First, all traits have been
rewritten to use variable templates instead of struct traits. This makes the
code much nicer in my opinion. Moreover, I've started experimenting with C++17
&lt;code&gt;if constexpr&lt;/code&gt;. Most of the if conditions that can be transformed to if
constexpr have been annotated with comments that I can quickly enable or disable
so that I can test the impact of C++17, especially on compilation time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a few bugs have been fixed. ETL is now working better with parallel
BLAS library. There should not be issues with double parallelization in ETL and
BLAS. There was a slight bug in the Column-Major matrix-matrix multiplication
kernel. Binary operations with different types in the left and right hand sides
was also problematic with vectorization. The last bug was about GPU status in
case ETL containers were moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't yet know exactly on which features I'm going to focus for the next
version of ETL. I plan to focus a bit more in the near future on Deep Learning
Library (DLL) for which I should release the version 1.0 soon. I also plan to
start support for Recurrent Neural Networks on it, so that will take me quite
some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I'm still planning to consider the switch to C++17, since it is
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/09/how-i-made-deep-learning-library-38-faster-to-compile-optimization-and-cpp17-if-constexpr.html"&gt;a bit faster to compile ETL with if constexpr&lt;/a&gt;. The next version of ETL will also probably have GPU-support for
integers, at least in the cases that depend on the etl-gpu-blas library, which
is the standard operators. I also plan to improve the support for complex
numbers, especially in terms of performance and tests. Hopefully, I will have also time (and motivation)
to start working on  the sparse capabilities of ETL. It really needs much more
unit tests and the performance should be improved as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="download-etl"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download ETL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download ETL &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl"&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt;. If you
only interested in the 1.2 version, you can look at the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl/releases"&gt;Releases pages&lt;/a&gt; or clone the tag
1.2. There are several branches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; Is the eternal development branch, may not always be stable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt; Is a branch always pointing to the last tag, no development here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the future release, there always will tags pointing to the corresponding
commits. You can also have access to previous releases on Github or via the
release tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation is still a bit sparse. There are a few examples and the Wiki,
but there still is work to be done. If you have questions on how to use or
configure the library, please don't hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't hesitate to comment this post if you have any comment on this library or
any question. You can also open an Issue on Github if you have a problem using
this library or propose a Pull Request if you have any contribution you'd like
to make to the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this may be useful to some of you :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/07/update-on-deep-learning-library-dll-dropout-batch-normalization-adaptive-learning-rates.html"&gt;the new features of my Deep Learning Library (DLL)&lt;/a&gt;
project. I've mentioned that, on several experiments, DLL was always
significantly faster than some popular deep learning frameworks such as
TensorFlow. I'll now go into more details into this comparison and provide all
the results. So far, the paper we wrote about these results has not been
published, so I'll not provide the paper directly yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that may not know, DLL is the project I've been developing to support
my Ph.D. thesis. This is a neural network framework  that supports
Fully-Connected Neural Network (FCNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Convolutional RBM
(CRBM) and Convolutional DBN (CDBN). It also supports a large variety of options
such as Dropout, Batch Normalization and Adaptive Learning Rates. You can read
read the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/07/update-on-deep-learning-library-dll-dropout-batch-normalization-adaptive-learning-rates.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;
if you want more information about the new features of the framework. And, as those of
you that read my blog frequently may know, I'm a bit obsessed with performance
optimization, so I've spent a considerable amount of time optimizing
the performance of neural network training, on CPU. Since, at the beginning of my
thesis, I had no access to GPU for training, I've focused on CPU. Although there
is now support for GPU, the gains are not yet important enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="evaluation"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see how fast, or not, the library was, it was compared against five popular
machine learning libraries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caffe, installed from sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TensorFlow 1.0, from pip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keras 2.0, from pip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Torch, installed from sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DeepLearning4J 0.7, from Maven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've run four different experiments with all these frameworks and compared the
efficiency of each of them for training the same neural networks with the same
options. In each case, the training or testing error have also been compared to
ensure that each framework is doing roughly the same. I wont present here the
details, but in each experiment DLL showed around the same accuracies as the
other frameworks. I will only focus on the speed results in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each experiment is done once with only CPU and once with a GPU. For DLL, I only
report the CPU time in both modes, since it's more stable and more optimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for the evaluation is available online on the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/frameworks"&gt;Github repository of the frameworks project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mnist-fully-connected-neural-network"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MNIST: Fully Connected Neural Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first experiment is performed on The MNIST data set. It consists of 60'000
grayscale images of size 28x28. The goal is to classify each image of a digit
from 0 to 9. To solve this task, I trained a very small fully-connected neural
network with 500 hidden units in the first layer, 250 in the second and 10 final
hidden units (or output units) for classification. The first two layers are
using the logistic sigmoid activation function and the last layer is using the
softmax activation function. The network is trained for 50 epochs with a
categorical cross entropy loss, with mini-batches of 100 images. Here are
results of this experiment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Training time performance for the different frameworks on the Fully-Connected Neural Network experiment, on MNIST." src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/dll_fcnn.png"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Training time performance for the different frameworks on the Fully-Connected
Neural Network experiment, on MNIST. All the times are in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DLL mode, the DLL framework is the clear winner here! It's about 35% faster
than TensorFlow and Keras which are coming at the second place. DLL is more than
four times slower than DLL and the last two frameworks (Caffe and
DeepLearning4J) are five times slower than DLL! Once we add a GPU to the system,
the results are very different. Caffe is now the fastest framework, three times
faster than DLL. DLL is less than two times slower than Keras and TensorFlow.
Interestingly, DLL is still faster than Torch and DeepLearning4J.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mnist-convolutional-neural-network"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MNIST: Convolutional Neural Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a Fully-Connected Neural Network is an interesting tool, the trend now
is to use Convolutional Neural Network which have proved very efficient at
solving a lot of problems. The second experiment is also using the same data
set. Again, it's a rather small network. The first layer is a convolutional
layer with 8 5x5 kernels, followed by max pooling layer with 2x2 kernel. They
are followed by one more convolutional layers with 8 5x5 kernels and a 2x2 max
pooling layer. These first four layers are followed by two fully-connected
layers, the first with 150 hidden units and the last one with 10 output units.
The activation functions are the same as for the first network, as is the
training procedure. This takes significantly longer to train than the first
network because of the higher complexity of the convolutional layers compared to
the fully-connected layers even though they have much less weights. The results
are present in the next figure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Training time performance for the different frameworks on the Convolutional Neural Network experiment, on MNIST." src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/dll_cnn.png"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Training time performance for the different frameworks on the Convolutional
Neural Network experiment, on MNIST. All the times are in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, on CPU, DLL is the clear winner, by a lot! It's already 3.6 times faster
than the second frameworks Keras and TensorFlow, more than four times faster
than Caffe and Torch and 8 times faster than DeepLearning4J that is proving very
slow on this experiment. Once a GPU is added, Keras and TensorFlow are about
twice faster than DLL. However, DLL is still faster than the other frameworks
even though they are taking advantage of the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cifar-10"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CIFAR-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second data set that is tested is the CIFAR-10 data set. It's an object
recognition with 10 classes for classification. The training set is composed of
50'000 colour images for 32x32 pixels. The network that is used for this data
set is similar in architecture than the first network, but has more parameters.
The first convolutional layer now has 12 5x5 kernels and the second
convolutional layer has 24 3x3 kernels. The pooling layers are the same. The
first fully-connected has 64 hidden units and the last one has 10 output units.
The last layer again use a softmax activation function while the other layers
are using Rectifier Linear Units (ReLU). The training is done in the same manner
as for the two first networks. Unfortunately, it was not possible to train
DeepLearning4J on this data set, even though there is official support for this
data set. Since I've had no answer to my question regarding this issue, the
results are simply removed from this experiment. It may not seem so but it's
considerably longer to train this network because of the larger number of input
channels and larger number of convolutional kernels in each layer. Let's get to
the results now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Training time performance for the different frameworks on the Convolutional Neural Network experiment, on CIFAR-10." src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/dll_cifar10.png"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Training time performance for the different frameworks on the Convolutional
Neural Network experiment, on CIFAR-10. All the times are in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DLL is still the fastest on CPU, but the margin is less than before. It's about
40% faster than TensorFlow and Keras, twice faster than Torch and 2.6 times
faster than Caffe. Once a GPU is added, DLL is about as fast as Torch but slower
than the other three frameworks. TensorFlow and Keras are about four times
faster than DLL while Caffe is about twice faster than DLL. We can see that
with this larger network, the GPU becomes more interesting and that there is
a smaller margin for improvements compared to the other frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="imagenet"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ImageNet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last experiment is made on the ImageNet data set. I used the ILSVRC 2012
subset, that consists "only" of about 1.2 million images for training. I've
resized all the images to 256x256 pixels, this makes for 250 times more colour
values than a MNIST image. This dimension and the number of images makes it
impractical to keep the dataset in memory. The images must be loaded in batch
from the disk. No random cropping or mirroring was performed. The network is
much larger to solve this task. The network starts with 5 pairs of convolutional
layers and max pooling layers. The convolutional layers have 3x3 kernels, 16 for
the first two layers and 32 for the three following one. The five max pooling
layers use 2x2 kernels. Each convolutional layer uses zero-padding so that their
output features are the same dimensions as the input. They are followed by two
fully-connected layer. The first one with 2048 hidden units and the last one
with 1000 output units (one for each class). Except for the last layer, using
softmax, the layers all uses ReLU. The network is trained with mini-batches of
128 images (except for DeepLearning4J and Torch, which can only use 64 images on
the amount of RAM available on my machine). To ease the comparison, I report the
time necessary to train one batch of data (or two for DeepLearning4J and Torch).
The results, presented in logarithmic scale because of DeepLearning4J disastrous
results, are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Training time performance for the different frameworks on the Convolutional Neural Network experiment, on ImageNet." src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/dll_imagenet.png"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Training time performance for the different frameworks on the Convolutional
Neural Network experiment, on ImageNet. The times are the time necessary to
train a batch of 128 images. All the times are in milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this final experiment, DLL is again significantly faster than all the other
frameworks. It's about 40% faster than Keras, twice faster than TensorFlow and
Caffe and more than three times faster than Torch. Although 40% may seem not
that much, don't forget that this kind of training may take days, so it can save
you a lot of time. All the frameworks are much faster than DeepLearning4J. Based
on several posts on the internet, I suspect that this comes from the model of
GPU I have been used (GTX 960), but all the other frameworks seem to handle this
card pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this is not too much of a bragging post :P We can see that my efforts to
make the code as fast as possible have paid :) As was shown in the experiments,
my DLL framework is always the fastest framework when the neural network is
trained on CPU. I'm quite pleased with the results since I've done a lot of work
to optimize the speed as much as possible and since I'm competing with
well-known libraries that have been developed by several persons.  Moreover, the
accuracies of the trained networks is similar to that of the networks trained
with the other frameworks. Even when the other frameworks are using GPU, the
library still remains competitive, although never the fastest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next step (I've no idea when I'll have the time though), I will want to
focus on GPU speed. This will mostly come from a better support of the GPU in
the ETL library on which DLL is based. I have many ideas to improve it a lot,
but it will take me a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more information on the DLL library, you can have a look at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/dll"&gt;its Github repository&lt;/a&gt; and especially at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/dll/tree/master/examples/src"&gt;the few examples&lt;/a&gt;.
You can also have a look at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://baptiste-wicht.com/categories/dll.html"&gt;my posts about DLL&lt;/a&gt;.
Finally, don't hesitate to comment or contact me through Github issues if you
have comments or problems with this post, the library or anything ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me longer than I thought, but I'm glad to announce the release of the
version 1.1 of my Expression Templates Library (ETL) project. This is a major
new release with many improvements and new features. It's been almost one month
since the last, and first, release (1.0) was released. I should have done some
minor releases in the mean time, but at least now the library is in a good shape
for major version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be interesting to note that my machine learning framework (DLL), based on
the ETL library, has shown to be faster than all the tested popular frameworks
(Tensorflow, Keras, Caffee, Torch, DeepLearning4J) for training various neural
networks on CPU. I'll post more details on another post on the coming weeks, but
that shows that special attention to performance has been done in this library
and that it is well adapted to machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you that don't follow my blog, ETL is a library providing
Expression Templates for computations on matrix and vector. For instance, if you
have three matrices A, B and C you could write C++ code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code cpp"&gt;&lt;a name="rest_code_3560cf90c38844ddbcc372fbe5cf9afd-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or given vectors b, v, h and a matrix W, you could write code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code cpp"&gt;&lt;a name="rest_code_cd5efbf4e37847a0b2d5f1aab4bcc6e8-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sigmoid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of such library is two-fold. First, this makes the expression more
readable and as close to math as possible. And then, it allows the library to
compute the expressions as fast as possible.  In the first case, the framework
will compute the sum using a vectorized algorithm and then compute the overall
expression using yet again vectorized code. The expression can also be computed
in parallel if the matrices are big enough. In the second case, the
vector-matrix multiplication will be computed first using either hand-code
optimized vectorized or a BLAS routine (depending on configuration options).
Then, all the expression will be executed using vectorized code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="features"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many new features have been integrated into the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The support for machine learning operations has been improved. There are now
specific helpers for machine learning in the etl::ml namespace which have names
that are standard to machine learning. A real transposed convolution has been
implemented with support for padding and stride. Batched outer product and
batched bias averaging are also now supported. The activation function support
has also been improved and the derivatives have been reviewed. The pooling
operators have also been improved with stride and padding support. Unrelated to
machine learning, 2D and 3D pooling can also be done in higher dimensional
matrix now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New functions are also available for matrices and vectors. The support for
square root has been improved with cubic root and inverse root. Support has also
been added for floor and ceil. Moreover, comparison operators are now available
as well as global functions such as approx_equals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New reductions have also been added with support for absolute sum and mean
(asum/asum) and for min_index and max_index, which returns the index of the
minimum element, respectively the maximum. Finally, argmax can now be used to
get the max index in each sub dimensions of a matrix. argmax on a vector is
equivalent to max_index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for shuffling has also been added. By default, shuffling a vector means
shuffling all elements and shuffling a matrix means shuffling by shuffling the
sub matrices (only the first dimension is shuffled), but shuffling a matrix as
a vector is also possible. Shuffle of two vectors or two matrices in parallel,
is also possible. In that case, the same permutation is applied to both
containers. As a side note, all operations using random generation are also
available with an addition parameter for the random generator, which can help to
improve reproducibility or simply tune the random generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also included support for adapters matrices. There are adapters for
hermitian matrices, symmetric matrices and lower and upper triangular matrices.
For now, the framework does not take advantage of this information, this will be
done later, but the framework guarantee the different constrain on the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also a few new more minor features. Maybe not so minor, matrices can
now be sliced into sub matrices. With that a matrix can be divided into several
sub matrices and modifying the sub matrices will modify the source matrix. The
sub matrices are available in 2D, 3D and 4D for now. There are also some other
ways of slicing matrix and vectors. It is possible to obtain a slice of its
memory or obtain a slice of its first dimension. Another new feature is that it
is now possible compute the cross product of vectors now. Matrices can be
decomposed into their Q/R decomposition rather than only their PALU
decomposition. Special support has been integrated for matrix and vectors of
booleans. In that case, they support logical operators such as and, not and or.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="performance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always considered the performance of this library to be a feature itself.
I consider the library to be quite fast, especially its convolution support,
even though there is still room for improvement. Therefore, many improvements
have been made to the performance of the library since the last release. As said
before, this library was used in a machine learning framework which then proved
faster than most popular neural network frameworks on CPU. I'll present here
the most important new improvements to performance, in no real particular order,
every bit being important in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, several operations have been optimized to be faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiplication of matrices or matrices and vectors are now much faster if one of
the matrix is transposed. Instead of performing the slow transposition,
different kernels are used in order to maximize performance without doing any
transposition, although sometimes transposition is performed when it is faster.
This leads to very significant improvements, up to 10 times faster in the best
case. This is performed for vectorized kernels and also for BLAS and CUBLAS
calls. These new kernels are also directly used when matrices of different
storage order are used. For instance, multiplying a column major matrix with
a row major matrix and storing the result in a column major matrix is now much
more efficient than before. Moreover, the performance of the transpose operation
itself is also much faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of machine learning operations have also been highly optimized. All the
pooling and upsample operators are now parallelized and the most used kernel
(2x2 pooling) is now more optimized. 4D convolution kernels (for machine
learning) have been greatly improved. There are now very specialized vectorized
kernels for classic kernel configurations (for instance 3x3 or 5x5) and the
selection of implementations is now smarter than before. The support of padding
is now much better than before for small amount of padding. Moreover, for small
kernels the full convolution can now be evaluated using the valid convolution
kernels directly with some padding, for much faster overall performance. The
exponential operation is now vectorized which allows operations such as sigmoid
or softmax to be much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrices and vector are automatically using aligned memory. This means that
vectorized code can use aligned operations, which may be slightly faster.
Moreover, matrices and vectors are now padded to a multiple of the vector size.
This allows to remove the final non-vectorized remainder loop from the
vectorized code. This is only done for the end of matrices, when they are
accessed in flat way. Contrary to some frameworks, inner dimensions of the
matrix are not padded.  Finally, accesses to 3D and 4D matrices is now much
faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the parallelization feature of ETL has been completely reworked. Before,
there was a thread pool for each algorithm that was parallelized. Now, there is
a global thread engine with one thread pool. Since parallelization is not nested
in ETL, this improves performance slightly by greatly diminishing the number of
threads that are created throughout an application. Another big difference in
parallel dispatching is that now it can detect good split based on alignment so
that each split are aligned. This then allows the vectorization process to use
aligned stores and loads instead of unaligned ones which may be faster on some
processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vectorization has also been greatly improved in ETL. Integer operations are now
automatically vectorized on processors that support this. Before, only floating
points operations were vectorized. The automatic vectorizer now is able to use
non-temporal stores for very large operations. A non-temporal store bypasses the
cache, thus gaining some time. Since very large matrices do not fit in cache
anyway and the cache would end up being overwritten anyway, this is a net gain.
Moreover, the alignment detection in the automatic vectorizer has also been
improved. Support for Fused-Multiply-Add (FMA) operations has also been
integrated in the algorithms that can make use of it (multiplications and
convolutions). The matrix-matrix multiplications and vector-matrix
multiplications now have highly optimized vectorized kernels. They also have
versions for column-major matrices now.  I plan to reintegrate a version of the
GEMM based on BLIS in the future but with more optimizations and support for all
precisions and integers, For my version is still slower than the simple
vectorized version. The sum and the dot product operations now also have
specialized vectorized implementations. The min and max operations are now
automatically-vectorized. Several others algorithms have also their own
vectorized implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, the GPU support has also been almost completely reworked.
Now, several operations can be chained without any copies between GPU and CPU.
Several new operations have also been added with support to GPU (convolutions,
pooling, sigmoid, ReLU, ...). Moreover, to complement operations that are not
available in any of the supported NVIDIA libraries, I've created a simple
library that can be used to add a few more GPU operations.  Nevertheless a lot
of operations are still missing and only algorithms are available not
expressions (such as c = a + b * 1.0) that are entirely computed on CPU. I have
plans to improve that further, probably for version 1.2. The different contexts
necessary for NVIDIA library can now be cached (using an option from ETL),
leading to much faster code. Only the main handle can be cached so far, I plan
to try to cache all the descriptors, but I don't know yet when that will be
ready. Finally, an option is also available to reuse GPU memory instead of
directly releasing it to CUDA. This is using a custom memory pool and can save
some time. Since this needs to be cleaned (by a call to etl::exit() or using
ETL_PROLOGUE), this is only activated on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-changes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also have been a lot of refactorings in the code of the library. A lot of
expressions now have less overhead and are specialized for performance.
Moreover, temporary expressions have been totally reworked to be more simple and
maintainable and easier to optimize in the future. It's also probably easier to
add new expressions to the framework now, although that could be even more
simple. There are also less duplicated code now in the different expressions.
Especially, now there are now more SSE and AVX variants in the code. All the
optimized algorithms are now using the vectorization system of the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried my best to reduce the compilation time, based on the unit tests.
This is still not great but better than before. For user code, the next version
should be much faster to compile since I plan to disable forced selection of
implementations by default and only enable it on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there also was quite a few bug fixes. Most of them have been found by
the use of the library in the Deep Learning Library (DLL) project. Some were
very small edge cases. For instance, the transposition algorithm was not working
on GPU on rectangular column major matrices. There also was a slight bug in the
Q/R decomposition and in the pooling of 4D matrices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time, I may do some minor release, but I don't yet have a complete plan.
For the next major release (1.2 probably), here is what is planned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the system for selection of algorithms to reduce compilation time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the GPU system to allow more complete support for standard operators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch to C++17: there are many improvements that could be done to the code with C++17 features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add support for convolution on mixed types (float/double)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More tests for sparse matrix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More algorithms support for sparse matrix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the compilation time of the library in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the compilation and execution time of the unit tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are pretty big changes, especially the first two, so maybe it'll be split
into several releases. It will really depend on the time I have. As for C++17,
I really want to try it and I have a lot of points that could profit from the
switch, but that will means setting GCC 7.1 and Clang 3.9 as minimum
requirement, which may not be reasonable for every user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="download-etl"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download ETL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download ETL &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl"&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt;. If you
only interested in the 1.1 version, you can look at the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl/releases"&gt;Releases pages&lt;/a&gt; or clone the tag
1.1. There are several branches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; Is the eternal development branch, may not always be stable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt; Is a branch always pointing to the last tag, no development here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the future release, there always will tags pointing to the corresponding
commits. I'm not following the git flow way, I'd rather try to have a more
linear history with one eternal development branch, rather than an useless
develop branch or a load of other branches for releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation is a bit sparse. There are a few examples and the Wiki, but
there still is work to be done. If you have questions on how to use or configure
the library, please don't hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't hesitate to comment this post if you have any comment on this library or
any question. You can also open an Issue on Github if you have a problem using
this library or propose a Pull Request if you have any contribution you'd like
to make to the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this may be useful to some of you :)&lt;/p&gt;

environment and simply to use either the TensorFlow official packages in pip or
use one of the official wheels for distributions.  There is one big problem with
that technique and it's the fact that the binaries are precompiled so that they
fit as many hardware configuration as possible. This is normal from Google since
generating precompiled binaries for all the possible combinations of processor
capabilities would be a nightmare. This is not a problem for GPU
since the CUDA Libraries will take care of the difference from one graphics card
to another. But it is a problem with CPU performance. Indeed, different
processors have different capabilities. For instance, the vectorization
capabilities are different from processor to processor (SSE, AVX, AVX2,
AVX-512F, FMA, ...). All those options can make a significant difference in the
performance of the programs. Although most of the machine learning training
occurs on GPU most of the time, the inference is mostly done on the CPU.
Therefore, it probably remains important to be as fast as possible on CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you care about performance on CPU, you should install TensorFlow from
sources directly yourself. This will allow compilation of the TensorFlow sources
with -march=native which will enable all the hardware capabilities of machine on
which you are compiling the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your problem, this may give you some nice speedup. In my case, on
a very small Recurrent Neural Network, it made inference about 20% faster.  On
a larger problem and depending on your processor, you may gain much more than
that. If you are training on CPU, this may make a very large difference in total
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing TensorFlow is sometimes a bit cumbersome. You'll likely have to
compile Bazel from sources as well and depending on your processor, it may take
a long time to finish. Nevertheless, I have successfully compiled TensorFlow
from sources on several machines now without too many problems. Just pay close
attention to the options you are setting while configuring TensorFlow, for
instance CUDA configuration if you want GPU support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this little trick will help you gain some time :)&lt;/p&gt;

There is some work to do before I release the next version, but I wanted to give you a quick update on what has been going on for ETL in the last months. There has been a lot of changes in the library and the next version will be a major update when I'm done with some refactorings and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my thesis supervisor, the project now has a logo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="ETL Logo" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/logo.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few new features, although probably nothing really major. The
support for square root has been improved with cubic root and inverse root.
Vectors can now be transformed using floor and ceil. Cross product of vector has
been implemented as well. Batched outer product and batched bias averaging (for
machine learning) are now supported. Reductions have also been improved with
absolute sum and mean (asum/asum) support and min_index and max_index. argmax
can now be used to get the max index in each sub dimensions. Matrix can now be
decomposed into their Q/R decomposition rather than only their PALU
decomposition. The matrices can now be sliced by getting only a sub part of the
matrix. The pooling operators  have also been improved with stride and padding
support. Matrices and vectors can also be shuffled. Moreover, a few adapters
are now available for hermitian matrices, symmetric matrices and lower and upper
matrices. So far the support for these adapters is not huge, but they are
guaranteed to validate their constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several operations have been optimized for speed. All the pooling and upsample
operators are now parallelized and the most used kernel (2x2 pooling) is now
more optimized. 4D convolution kernels (for machine learning) have been greatly
improved. There are now very specialized vectorized kernels for classic kernel
configurations (for instance 3x3 or 5x5) and the selection of implementations is
now smarter than before. The support of padding now much better than before for
small amount of padding. Moreover, for small kernels the full convolution can
now be evaluated using the valid convolution kernels directly with some padding,
for much faster overall performance. Matrix-matrix multiplication with
transposed matrices is now much faster when using BLAS kernels. Indeed, the
transposition is not performed but handled inside the kernels. Moreover, the
performance of the transposition itself is also much faster. Finally, accesses
to 3D and 4D matrices is now much faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parallelization feature of ETL has been completely reworked. Before, there
was a thread pool for each algorithm that was parallelized. Now, there is
a global thread engine with one thread pool. Since parallelization is not nested

Fused-Multiply-Add (FMA) operations has also been integrated in the algorithms
that can make use of it. The matrix-matrix multiplications and vector-matrix
multiplications now have optimized vectorized kernels. They also have versions
for column-major matrices now. The old egblas version of the gemm, based on BLIS
kernels, has been removed since it was only supporting double-precision and was
not faster than the new vectorized algorithm. I plan to reintegrate a version of
the GEMM based on BLIS in the future but with more optimizations and support for
all precisions and integers. The sum and the dot product now also have
specialized vectorized implementations. The min and max operations are now
automatically-vectorized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GPU has also been almost completely reworked. Now, operations can be chained

expressions now have less overhead and are specialized for performance.
Moreover, temporary expressions are currently being reworked in order to be more
simple and maintainable and easier to optimize in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there also was quite a few bug fixes. Most of them have been found by
the use of the library in the Deep Learning Library (DLL) project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>C++</category><category>C++14</category><category>etl</category><category>GPU</category><category>Performance</category><category>projects</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/05/update-on-expression-templates-library-etl.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2017 19:31:48 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
