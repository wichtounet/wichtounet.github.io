environment and simply to use either the TensorFlow official packages in pip or
use one of the official wheels for distributions.  There is one big problem with
that technique and it's the fact that the binaries are precompiled so that they
fit as many hardware configuration as possible. This is normal from Google since
generating precompiled binaries for all the possible combinations of processor
capabilities would be a nightmare. This is not a problem for GPU
since the CUDA Libraries will take care of the difference from one graphics card
to another. But it is a problem with CPU performance. Indeed, different
processors have different capabilities. For instance, the vectorization
capabilities are different from processor to processor (SSE, AVX, AVX2,
AVX-512F, FMA, ...). All those options can make a significant difference in the
performance of the programs. Although most of the machine learning training
occurs on GPU most of the time, the inference is mostly done on the CPU.
Therefore, it probably remains important to be as fast as possible on CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you care about performance on CPU, you should install TensorFlow from
sources directly yourself. This will allow compilation of the TensorFlow sources
with -march=native which will enable all the hardware capabilities of machine on
which you are compiling the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your problem, this may give you some nice speedup. In my case, on
a very small Recurrent Neural Network, it made inference about 20% faster.  On
a larger problem and depending on your processor, you may gain much more than
that. If you are training on CPU, this may make a very large difference in total
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing TensorFlow is sometimes a bit cumbersome. You'll likely have to
compile Bazel from sources as well and depending on your processor, it may take
a long time to finish. Nevertheless, I have successfully compiled TensorFlow
from sources on several machines now without too many problems. Just pay close
attention to the options you are setting while configuring TensorFlow, for
instance CUDA configuration if you want GPU support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this little trick will help you gain some time :)&lt;/p&gt;

interest you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307908790_On_CPU_Performance_Optimization_of_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine_and_Convolutional_RBM"&gt;On CPU Performance Optimizations for Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Convolutional RBM&lt;/a&gt;, published in the Proceedings of the Artificial Neural Networks and Pattern Recognition workshop (ANNPR-2016). I've presented this paper in Germany, at Ulm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most of the performance research going on is focused on GPU, there are
still of research laboratories that are only equipped with CPU and it remains
important to be as fast as possible on CPU. Moreover, this is something
I really like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this publication, I have tried to make my Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
and Convolutional RBM (CRBM) implementations in my DLL library as fast as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the article is about Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) which
are a form of dense Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Their training is very
similar to that of the ANN with Gradient Descent. Four different network
configurations are being tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, mini-batch training is shown to be much faster than online training, even
when online training is performed in parallel. Once mini-batch training is used,
BLAS operations are used in order to get as much performance as possible on the
different operations, mainly the Matrix Matrix Multiplication with the use of
the GEMM operation from the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL). Moreover, the
parallel version of the MKL is also used to get even more performance. When all
these optimizations are performed, speedups of 11 to 30 are obtained compared to
the online training, depending on the network configurations. This final version
is able  to perform one epoch of Contrastive Divergence in 4 to 15 seconds
depending on the network, for 60000 images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the article is about Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann
Machine (CRBM). This is almost the equivalent of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). Again four different networks are evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem with CRBM is that there are no standard implementations of the
convolution operation that is really fast. Therefore, it is not possible to
simply use a BLAS library to make the computation as fast as possible. The first
optimization that was tried is to vectorize the convolutions. With this, the
speedups have been between 1.1 and 1.9 times faster. I'm not really satisfied
with these results since in fact per convolution the speedups are much better.
Moreover, I have since been able to obtain better speedups but the deadline was
too short to include them in this paper. I'll try to talk about these
improvements in more details on this blog. What is more interesting to to
parallellize the different convolutions since they are mostly independent. This
can bring a speedup of the amount of cores available on the machine. Since
convolutions are extremely memory hungry, virtual cores with Hyper Threading
generally does not help. An interesting optimization is to use a Matrix
Multiplication to compute several valid convolutions at once.  This can give an
additional speedup between 1.6 and 2.2 compared to the vectorized version. While
it is possible to use the FFT to reduce the full convolution as well, in our
experiment the images were not big enough for this to be interesting. The final
speedups are about 10 times faster with these optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have obtained pretty good and I'm happy we have been published. However, I'm
not very satisfied with these results since I've been able to get even faster
since this and when compared with other frameworks, DLL is actually quite
competitive. I'll try to publish something new in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
