Although working very well, my 3Com managed was too much noisy for being at home. That is why I decided to change it for fanless switch. After some research, I finally chose a ZyXEL GS1910-24. It is a web-manageable gigabit switch. I chose the 24 ports version. This version has also 4 SFPs that replace 4 normal ports if enabled. I don't think I will ever need the SFPs, but it is nice to know that there are here if necessary. This switch has a lot of cool features, it supports IPV6, QoS, VLANs, filtering, RADIUS and so on.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The package&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package does not contains a lot of things, but does contain the essential:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 13px;"&gt;The switch itself&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A power code&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Rack mounting brackets and screws&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Manuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture on the package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-11-16.51.47.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2574" alt="2013-07-11 16.51.47" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-11-16.51.47-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The switch is really small, twice narrower than my 3Com switch and more than twice lighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing special to say about the package, it is neatly done and has everything that is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Installation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation inside a rack is really easy. Each bracket is mounted with 4 screws onto the switch and then two screws are holding each bracket into place in the rack. Here is a picture of the rack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-11-17.07.00.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2575" alt="2013-07-11 17.07.00" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-11-17.07.00-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you put the power cord, it directly starts up and everything already works fine. The state of each port is represented by a led. Orange indicates a 100Mbit/s connection while green indicates 1Gbit/s connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The switch does not make a single noise and does not vibrate, it is really good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Configuration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to configure the switch is to use the web configurator. By default, the switch IP is 192.168.1.1. As my router had the same IP, I had to disable it temporarily before changing the IP of the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web configuration is very complete, you can change absolutely everything from here. You have also access to a lot of monitoring tools from here. The most useful being of course the port monitoring interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screenshot-from-2013-07-11-172745.png"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2576" alt="Port Monitoring" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screenshot-from-2013-07-11-172745-300x132.png" width="300" height="132"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend changing the default IP address and the server password as first things on the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't make the list of everything that is configurable on this switch, but the list is pretty impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm really impressed by this switch. The switch is highly configurable and seems to perfectly fit my need. I would totally recommend this switch for rack installation at home. You can also totally use it as a desktop switch if you needs for a big switch on your desktop too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Hardware</category><category>Home Server</category><category>Network</category><category>Server</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2013/07/zyxel-gs1910-managed-gigabit-switch-review.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2013 08:38:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Home Server Adventure - Step 1</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2013/07/home-server-adventure-step-1.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years now, I've almost always had a server running at home. First it was an old desktop computer and then it was a QNAP NAS. The problem with the QNAP is that it is not fast at all and not as flexible as I would like it to be. Moreover, I was also running a Teamspeak server on my desktop for when my friends and I were playing together. So I decided to first install a simple server to replace my teamspeak server and I would services of my NAS with my new server. But this time, I decided to go for the complete option: A 19" rack :)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Hardware&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I bought all I needed to install my 19" rack at home. I bought everything already used on auctions on Ricardo/Anibis (Switzerland Ebay equivalents) and Ebay. Here is what I got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 13px;"&gt;A 19" inch rack with 40 HE of the mark GURTNER + SCHNIEPP AG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A old Dell Poweredge 1850 server&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A 8-ports Compaq KVM switch&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A monitor/keyboard console for administrating the servers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A 3Com managed Gigabit switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got that for less than 500$. It is probably possible to get a similar configuration for less than that in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some pictures (sorry for the poor quality):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-05-17.58.322.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2568" alt="2013-07-05 17.58.32" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-05-17.58.322-576x1024.jpg" width="576" height="1024"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-05-17.59.232.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2567" alt="2013-07-05 17.59.23" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-05-17.59.232-576x1024.jpg" width="576" height="1024"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it is kind of empty. I will also put my NAS and my internet provider router in the rack in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A this time, the cables are not very good organized, I will try to purchase some guides to make that look better and I will also try to find a rack PDU to distribute power without cables everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also need to find two 120mm fans for the top of my case to improve air circulation. Very quiet 120mm can be found, so noise won't be a problem I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, I also plan to find an UPS, but they are very expensive, so I will continue looking at auctions for them. The problem being that the battery should not be too old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Software&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I've installed Gentoo on the server. At first, I wanted to install a Gentoo Hardened distribution with Selinux, but it turned out that it was too much of a hassle. After more than 10 hours of trying to make it work, I started again and in less than two hours my Gentoo installation was working. I will probably try again in the future, at least to harden the server and I hope it will go with less problems. The server is of course gui-less, only console access is more than sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now on, I have only a Teamspeak server and a Mumble server installed on the server, but I plan to add new services on it, Sabnzb for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also installed iptables to add some layer of protection, even if I don't think that it is necessary in my case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I used dyndns to map my public ip to a domain name to make it easier to reach. For now, I haven't installed an update client, but I plan to try ddclient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Problems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made some mistake when choosing the components for my installation. First of all, they are too noisy. The server and the switch are a real problem. They are both made for professional installations. Generally 1U server have very small fans (40mm generally) which are very noisy. So I decided to upgrade my configurations with two changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 13px;"&gt;I will buy a fanless switch, probably unmanaged. They are plenty of very good fanless switches, even managed one for a reasonable price. I will try to first find a used one on auction, but I may consider buying a new one, as there exists some for about a hundred dollars. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I will replace the Dell server with a custom server. I found some very good cases made by Norco. I'll buy a Micro ATX motherboard and install my old computer configuration (&lt;a title="Why and how I completely left Windows for Linux" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2013/07/why-how-left-windows-for-linux/"&gt;the one I had before&lt;/a&gt;) on it. It won't cost too much I think, although much more than the 30$ Dell server I have now ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem being that the Dell server is too deep for my rack, so I can't close the back part as you can see on the pictures, but replacing it with the Norco case will solve the problem :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might sound crazy to have a complete rack at home, but I thing that it is a great way to experience with servers and network. It is also quite practical if you plan to have several servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to post some posts on the subject on the future, so I hope  that it interests some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Gentoo</category><category>Hardware</category><category>Home Server</category><category>Network</category><category>Server</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2013/07/home-server-adventure-step-1.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2013 09:02:05 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
