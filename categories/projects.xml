&lt;p&gt;I just been informed that zapcc was just released in version 1.0. I though it
was a good occasion to test it again. It will be compared against gcc-4.9,
gcc-5.3 and clang-3.9. This version is based on the trunk of clang-5.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I will use my Expression Template Library (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl/"&gt;ETL&lt;/a&gt;) project. This is a purely header-only
library with lots of templates. I'm going to compile the full test cases. This
is a perfect example for long compilation times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current tests are made on the last version of the library and with slightly
different parameters for compilation, therefore the absolute times are not
comparable, but the speedups should be comparable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like last time, I have configured zapcc to let is use 2Go RAM per caching
server, which is the maximum allowed. Moreover, I killed the servers before each
tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="debug-results"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debug results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with a debug build, with no optimizations enabled. Every build will
use four threads. This is the equivalent of doing make -j4 debug/bin/etl_test
without the link step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="73%"&gt;
&lt;col width="27%"&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead valign="bottom"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class="head"&gt;Compiler&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;g++-4.9.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;190.09s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;g++-5.3.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;200.92s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang++-3.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;313.85&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;zapcc++&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;81.25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Speedup VS Clang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.86&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Speedup VS GCC-5.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.47&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Speedup VS GCC-4.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.33&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speedups are even more impressive than last time! zapcc is &lt;strong&gt;almost four
times fast than clang-3.9&lt;/strong&gt; and around &lt;strong&gt;2.5 times faster than GCC-5.3&lt;/strong&gt;.
Interestingly, we can see that gcc-5.3 is slighly slower than GCC-4.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that they have the compiler even faster!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="release-results"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Release results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look now how the results are looking with optimizations enabled. Again,
every build will use four threads. This is the equivalent of doing make -j4
release_debug/bin/etl_test without the link step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="75%"&gt;
&lt;col width="25%"&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead valign="bottom"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class="head"&gt;Compiler&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;g++-4.9.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;252.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;g++-5.3.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;264.96&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang++-3.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;361.65&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;zapcc++&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;237.96&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Speedup VS Clang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.51&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Speedup VS GCC-5.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Speedup VS GCC-4.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.06&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that this time the speedups are not as interesting as they were.
Very interestingly, it's the compiler that suffers the more from the
optimization overhead. Indeed, zapcc is three times slower in release mode than
it was in debug mode. Nevertheless, it still manages to beat the three other
compilers, by about 10% for Gcc and 50% than clang, which is already
interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, we have observed that zapcc is always faster than the three
compilers tested in this experiment. Moreover, in debug mode, the speedups are
very significant, it was almost 4 times faster than clang and around 2.5 faster
than gcc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't seen any problem with the tool, it's like clang and it should generate
code of the same performance, but just compile it much faster. One problem
I have with zapcc is that it is not based on an already released version of
clang but on the trunk. That means it is hard to be compare with the exact same
version of clang and it is also a risk of running into clang bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the prices have not been published yet, it is indicated on the website
that zapcc is free for non-commercial entities. Which is really great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.zapcc.com/"&gt;official website of zapcc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

power outlets, a few lights (more are coming), my Kodi home theater. And I have
a lot of sensors and information gathered by Domoticz. All of this is working
quite well, but I have only a few actuators and intelligence (motion sensor,
button and some automation via Lua script).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next objective was to add voice control to my system. If I was living in
United States or United Kingdom I would directly an Amazon Dot or even an Amazon
Echo, but they are not available in Switzerland. I could have arranged for
delivery, but if I want my system to be useful to several people, I need to have
in French. It's the same problem with the Google Home system. So, no other way
than custom solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I had an extra Raspberry Pi 2, I based my system on this. I bought a Trust
Mico microphone and a Trust Compact speakers and installed them on the Pi. Both
peripherals are working quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have a closer look at my microphone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Trust Mico microphone for Jarvis Home Automation Voice Control" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/jarvis_mic.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the complete installation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Jarvis Home Automation Voice Control around my TV" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/jarvis_full.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi is on the bottom, the speakers below the TV, left and right and
the microphone on the top right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the voice control software, I decided to go with Jarvis. It seems to me that
this is the best suited software for this kind of project. Moreover, it supports
French natively which seems good. I also tried Jasper, but this has been such
a pain to install that I gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarvis is reasonably easy to install if you have a recent Raspbian image. It
took some time to install the dependencies, but in the end it was not difficult.
The installation process has a step-by-step wizard help so it's really easy to
configure everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even if it's easy to install, it's easy to configure correctly. The
first thing is to configure the hotword to activate commands. There are several
options, but I used snowboy which is offline and is made for hotword
recognition. This worked quite well, you just have to train a model with the
hotword to recognize the voice. After this, the problems started... You then
have to configure audio for the commands themselves. There are 6 parameters for
audio capture (noise levels to start and stop the capture, silence levels, ...)
and no help to tune them. So basically, I tried a lot of combinations until
I had something working reasonably well. When you are in debug mode, you can
listen to what the system captured. These parameters are dependent on your
environment and on your microphone and on your voice. I may be dumb but it took
several hours and a lot of tries to get a configuration working. After this, you
have to choose the engine for recognition of the commands. Unfortunately, all
the good options are online so everything you'll say as commands after the
hotword will be sent online. I first tried Bing, but I had very poor recognition
rate. I then switched to wit.ai which gave me better results. In the end, I have
about 60% recognition rate, which is not great at all, but at least some phrases
are working almost all the time while others are always failing. Another problem
I have with this is the large delay between commands and action. It takes almost
five seconds between the end of my sentence and the time where the lights in my
living room are tuned on or off by Jarvis via Domoticz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I'm a bit disappointed by the quality of the system, but maybe I was
hoping for too much. I have been able to control a few of my appliances but not
really reliably. Another thing I have realized is that when counting the
Raspberry Pi, its enclosure the Microphone and the speakers, this system is more
costly than an Amazon Dot and seem highly inferior (and is much less good
looking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll try to improve the current system with better configuration and commands in
the coming days and I will maybe try another system for voice control. I still
hope Amazon Alexa systems or Google Home are made available in
France/Switzerland not too far in the future, since I believe these systems are
a better solution than custom made systems, at least for now. Moreover, next
month, I plan to integrate ZWave into my systems with a few sensors, complete
the lighting installation and add new motion sensors. This should make it more
useful. And hopefully, by this time, I should have a good voice control system,
but I'm not too hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't hesitate to comment or contact me if you have questions about this
installation or want to share experience about voice control in home automation.
If you want more details about this, dont' hesitate to ask as well ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Home Automation</category><category>Personal</category><category>projects</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/02/home-automation-first-attempt-voice-control-jarvis.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2017 17:34:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Add Milight smart lights to my Domoticz home automation system</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/01/add-milight-smart-lights-to-domoticz-home-automation-system.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/01/new-home-automation-system-with-domoticz.html#"&gt;I switched from my hand crafted home automation system to Domoticz&lt;/a&gt;.
This allows me to easily integrate new smart devices and remote controllable
peripherals without much effort. I plan to relate my effort in having fun
controlling my home :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm now able to control lights in two rooms with Domoticz. The most well-known
smart bulbs are the Philips Hue. However, they are stupidly expensive. There are
a lot of alternatives. I've ordered some Milight light bulbs and controller to
test with Domoticz. I didn't order a lot of them because I wanted to make sure
they would work with my system.
Milight system is working over Wifi. There are several components to a Milight
system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The LED Light Bulbs with Red/Green/Blue/White channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Wifi Controller that is able to control 4 zones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An RGBW Controller for LED strip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two are necessary for any installation, the third is to control an
RGBW LED strip. This list is not exhaustive, it's only the components that
I have used. It is important to note that a single Wifi controller can only
control 4 zones. There are also remotes, but I have not bought one since I plan
to use them only from Domoticz and maybe smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installation of the controller is relatively easy. You need to download the
Milight 2.0 application on the Android Play Store (or the equivalent for IOS).
Then, you can power on the Wifi Controller. It'll create a new Wifi on which you
can then connect on your phone. Then, you can use the application on your phone
to configure the device and make it connect to your home wireless network. Once,
this is done, you can connect your phone back to your home network. You can then
use the Milight application to configure your device. I highly recommend to set
a static IP address to the controller. The way I did it is simply to set a fixed
IP address on my DHCP server based on the MAC address of the MAC controller but
you can simply do the configuration in the application or in the web interface
of the controller (the user and password combination is admin:admin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the look of the controller (next to my RFLink):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Milight wifi controller" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/system.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(My phone is starting to die, hence the very bad quality of images)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then install your LED light bulbs. For, open first the remote on your
Android Milight application. Then plug the light bulb without power first. Then
power on the light and press once on one of the I buttons on one of the zones on
the remote. This will link the LED to the selected zone on the controller. You
can then control the light from your phone. Remember, only four zones and
therefore four lights per controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installation for a LED strip is not much complicated. You need to plug the
4 wires (or 5 wires if your have an actual RGBW LED) into the corresponding
inputs on the controller. Then, you power it and you can link it to a zone like
a normal light bulb!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="LEDS in my Living Room controlled by Milight" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/leds.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works really well and directly without problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step is of course to configure your controller in Domoticz. It is
really easy to do. You need to add a new hardware of each of the Milight
controller. It is listed under the name "Limitless/AppLamp/Mi Light with
LAN/WiFi interface". You then can set the IP address and the port by default is
8899. Once you did configure the hardware, you'll see new devices appear in the
Devices list. There will one device for each zone and one device to control all
four zones at once. You can add the device you already configured as switches.
From the Switches interface you can turn the lamp on and off and you can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Domoticz Light Bulbs control" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/domoticz_rgbw.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then put them on your floor plan or control them from your rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I'm pretty satisfied with this Milight system. The Android application
is of poor quality but aside from this is pretty good and the price is very
fair. I'm also really satisfied with the Domoticz support. The only that is sad
is that the Domoticz Android application does not support RGBW control of the
lamps, only on and off, but that is already cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that all of this is working well, I've ordered a few more light bulbs to
cover all my rooms and a few LED controller to control (and install first) the
other LEDS that I have in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another note, I've also added a new outside temperature sensor outside my
apartment. It is a very cheap Chinese sensor, bought on Ebay, based on the
XT200 system that is working very well with RFLink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in my system is probably to integrate Voice Control, but I don't
know exactly which way I'll go. I ordered a simple microphone that I intend to
plug on my spare Raspberry Pi, but I don't know if the range will be enough to
cover a room. Ideally, I would like to use an Amazon Dot, but they are not
available in Switzerland. I'll probably write more on the subject once I've
found an adequate solution. Another idea I've is to integrate support for ZWave
via OpenZWave and then add a few more cool sensors that I haven't found on an
cheaper system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this is interesting and don't hesitate if you have any question about my
home automation project. You can expect a few more posts about this as soon as
In improve it :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Home Automation</category><category>Personal</category><category>projects</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/01/add-milight-smart-lights-to-domoticz-home-automation-system.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2017 21:00:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New home automation system with Domoticz</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/01/new-home-automation-system-with-domoticz.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you may remember, I started going into Home Automation last year with a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2016/08/asgard-home-automation-project.html"&gt;C++ project, Asgard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I haven't add the time to improve this project further and make
it really useful and I have so many C++ projects already, so I decided to switch
to using an existing project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="choice"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed a system that was at least able to handle everything my existing system
does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control my RF-433 Temperature Sensors (Oregon Temperature Sensors)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control my RF-433 Remote Button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control my smart power outlets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ping and wake-on-lan my different computers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be installable on a Raspberry Pi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control Skadi/Kodi Home Cinema&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it also had to be open source and in a language that I can write
without agonizing pain (no Ruby, no JavaScript, ideally no Python (I hate a lot
of languages...)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's impressive the number of home automation projects that exist today. It's
really a hot topic, more than I though. After a few hours of research, I've
finally settled on Domoticz. It seemed that it could handle all my home
automation devices that I already had. Domoticz is an open source home
automation system. It's written mainly in C++, which is an advantage for me
since I'll be able to work inside it if necessary. It has a quite modern HTML5
interface. It has a lot of support for hardware and a lot of bridges for other
controllers as well. One of the reason I chose it is also the floor-planner
feature that looks really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="installation"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I cleaned the hardware of my Raspberry Pi. I got rid of my
breadboard and the components on it. Then, I put the Raspberry Pi on a nicer box
that I had laying around. One problem with Domoticz is that it does not support
directly RF433 devices, but need a controller in the middle. At first,
I believed I could simply connect them through GPIO and lets Domoticz do the
rest, but it's not possible. I ordered the different pieces for a RFLink
controller at nodo-shops. It is running on a Arduino Mega and is connected to
the Pi. The very big advantage is that they handle a lot of protocols directly,
so you only have to read the serial port to get information on RF-433 events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how the current system look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Asgard automation system hardware" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/home_automation_hardware.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The black box is the Arduino Mega with RFLink software while the Transparent is
simply the Raspberry on which Domoticz is installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the installation of Domoticz, it's really simple. They also have images of
Raspberry Pi directly, but since my Raspberry was already installed with
Raspbian, I installed Domoticz on it directly. A simple matter of curl and bash:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code bash"&gt;&lt;a name="rest_code_99d875d64b634552ab6e96c4b3ebcf69-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;sudo curl -L install.domoticz.com &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; sudo bash
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few questions, your installation should be complete. You can browse your
Domoticz installation at the IP of your Pi and at the given port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="home-automation-with-domoticz"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Home Automation with Domoticz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several concepts in Domoticz that are important. At first, it seemed
a bit weird to me, but in the end it works really well and you get used to it
pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first concept is the hardware. It is not necessary hardware directly, but
rather a driver to some piece of information of switches than a real hardware in
my opinion. For instance, the RFLink Gateway is considered hardware as well as
the Forecast weather API. Here is all the hardware I've configured:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Domoticz Hardware Configuration" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/domoticz_hardware.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got some sensors from the motherboard, the Kodi interaction, the driver to
ping the different computers, the Forecast weather with Dark Sky and Weather
Underground, the RFLink communication, the wake-on-lan and some dummies virtual
switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On its own, an hardware is useless, but it can create devices that will be used
for home automation. A device is sub device of a particular driver. In some
cases, the devices will be created automatically. For instance, RF Link can
create devices as soon as they are detected. For wake-on-lan, you have to
configure MAC Addresses and they will be added as devices. And so on...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of types of devices, also called switches. Some devices can do
some actions, for instance the wake-on-lan devices, while others are information
based such as ping or temperature sensors detected from the RFLink. For
instance, here are my temperature sensors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Domoticz Temperature Sensors" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/domoticz_temperature.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for my hardware I already had, I haven't add too many issues with them. The
Oregon Temperature Sensors worked out of the box without any issues as well my
old RF433 Ninja Block temperature sensor. The smart power outlets have been
pretty easy to use as well. The most problem I've add was with the remote
buttons. It seems to many that it should be the easiest, but RFLink has a lot of
problem with them, they are detected several times and are highly unreliable.
Interestingly you can also change the icon of most device to a large variety of
existing devices so that they would look more realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature I find pretty cool is the floor plan. You can create plans for
each floor of your house and then create rooms inside and finally attach devices
to each room and place inside the plan. Unfortunately, to draw the plan, you'll
have to use an external tool. I've used floorplanner for this, but you may use
any plan you have as long as you have an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my floor plan with the devices (the scale is terribly off :P) :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Domoticz Floor Plan" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/domoticz_floorplan.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that you can directly see the status of each of your sensors in each room.
Moreover, you can also activate some devices directly from the floor plan as
well :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, my Somfy blinds are supposed to work with the RFLink controller.
I have managed to control my blinds but only when the RFLink was within 50
centimeters of the Blinds, which is clearly not acceptable. I don't know from
where the problem comes. It may come from my Blinds controller inside the wall
or may come from bad antenna of the RFLink or from a bug in RFLink, so from now
I cannot control my blinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have several D-Link cameras at home. You can also add cameras to Domoticz, but
don't expect a lot of support on this side. It's pretty poor indeed. The only
useful you can do in Domoticz with Cameras is to take a screenshot from them.
You cannot control the Camera or even have a decent video stream and cannot do
motion detection directly. I hope that the Camera support will improve in the
future. One thing that would be good is to add a view of the cameras in the
floor plan, but it is not possible currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did is to use Zoneminder to manage the cameras and send alert to Domoticz
when motion is detect with the REST API of Domoticz. Unfortunately that means
two systems to manage the Cameras. Zoneminder is a very good piece of software,
but one of the ugliest I've ever seen (even I can do a better web interface...)
and quite obscure to configure. But the numbers of cameras it can handle and the
capabilities to control the camera is very very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="events-and-actions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Events and actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No home automation system would be complete without an events and rules system.
In Domoticz, you have several ways to create rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first solution is to create group. A group is simply a set of switches that
are all activated together. This is pretty limited, but can be useful. The
second solution is a scene. A scene is activated by a device and can set several
switches to on or off after the activation. The problem with this is that you
have to listen for an action as activation, you cannot use an existing device or
a rule with a value. For me, these two possibilities are way too limited and
I don't really a reason to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best solution is to script an handler. For that, there are two ways, either
you define visually your script with blocky, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Domoticz Blockly Rule" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/domoticz_blockly.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seemed so cool that I wanted to do all my rules with that. Unfortunately,
it is really limited. The main limitation is that you cannot nest if blocks. In
fact the interface lets you do, but it doesn't work afterwards. The other
limitation is that it has no notion of time. For instance, it's very hard to
create an action if a computer is shutdown for more than 60 seconds. You can do
it, but you end up creating virtual devices which are turned off after some
delay and it gets really complicated really soon...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I used Lua script directly. These scripts have the information about
the last values of each device and the last updated time as well. It's much
easier with that to create powerful rules especially when you want a notion of
time. There are plenty of examples on the Domoticz forum about very powerful
rules that you can create. Unfortunately, there are some limitations. For
instance, you cannot send several actions to the same device in the same script
Moreover, you also have to decode the values of the sensors yourself. For
instance, for a temperature and humidity sensor, you'll have to parse the values
and extract the one you need by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I haven't created many rules, only four. The first rule is that with the
push of one remote button I can power on my smart socket and turn on one of my
computers in my office. Then, if both the computers on this smart sockets have
been off for more than 60 seconds, the power is shut off on the smart socket.
And I have done almost the same for my media center and TV in my living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, I'll probably only use the Lua scripting capability. In my
opinion, it's better to have all the scripts in the same language for
maintainability reasons. Once my futures devices arrive, I'll have a few more
rules to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap up, I'd say that I'm pretty satisfied with my new home automation system
with Domoticz. It's not a perfect tool, but it has a lot of features and is
working quite well in general. I would recommend you to try it if you want
a good home automation system, fully featured and relatively easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've several more things planned for this system. I plan to test a real motion
sensor rather than rely only on the cameras which are focused on the doors and
windows. I also plan to add an outdoor temperature sensor. And more
interestingly, I'm going to try to integrate smart bulbs from Milight to be able
to control my lights from the system. These are the shot term projects that
I want to do, but I have many more ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also sure that there are some features from Domoticz that I have overlooked
or not discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll probably write more posts on Home Automation on the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on Domoticz, you can consult
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://domoticz.com/"&gt;the official Domoticz website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

On debug builds, zapcc was about 2 times faster than gcc and 3 times faster than clang. In this post, I'm going to try some more recent compilers, namely gcc 5.4 and clang 3.9 on the same project. If you want more information on zapcc, read the previous posts, this post will concentrate on results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I use my Expression Template Library
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl/"&gt;ETL&lt;/a&gt;). This is a purely header-only
library with lots of templates. I'm going to compile the full test cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the two articles are not directly comparable, since they were
obtained on two different computers. The one on which the present results are
done has a less powerful and only 16Go of RAM compared to the 32Go of RAM of my
build machine. Also take into account that that the present results were
obtained on a Desktop machine, there can be some perturbations from background
tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like on the previous results, it does not help using more threads than
physical cores, therefore, the results were only computed on up to 4 cores on
this machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link time is not taken into account on the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="debug-build"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debug build&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the result of the debug build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="55%"&gt;
&lt;col width="15%"&gt;
&lt;col width="15%"&gt;
&lt;col width="15%"&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead valign="bottom"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class="head"&gt;Compiler&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;-j1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;-j2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;-j4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;g++-5.4.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;469s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;230s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;130s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang++-3.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;710s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;371s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;218s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;zapcc++&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;214s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;112s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;66s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Speedup VS Clang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Speedup VS GCC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.05&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.96&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are almost the same as the previous test. zapcc is 3.3 times faster
to compile than Clang and around 2 times faster than GCC. It seems that GCC 5.4
is a bit faster than GCC 4.9.3 while clang 3.9 is a bit slower than clang 3.7,
but nothing terribly significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, for debug builds, zapcc can bring a very significant improvement to
your compile times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="release-build"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Release build&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see what is the status of Release builds. Since the results are comparable
between the numbers of threads, the results here are just for one thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more time consuming since a lot of optimizations are enabled and more
features from ETL are enabled as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="79%"&gt;
&lt;col width="21%"&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead valign="bottom"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class="head"&gt;Compiler&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;-j1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;g++-5.4.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;782s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang++-3.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;960s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;zapcc++&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;640s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Speedup VS Clang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Speedup VS GCC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a release build, the speedups are much less interesting. Nevertheless, they
are still significant. zapcc is still 1.2 times faster than gcc and 1.5 times
faster than clang. Then speedup against clang 3.9 is significantly higher than
it was on my experiment with clang 3.7, it's possible that clang 3.9 is slower
or simply has new optimization passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous conclusion still holds with modern version of compilers: zapcc is
much faster than other compilers on Debug builds of template heavy code. More
than 3 times faster than clang-3.9 and about 2 times faster than gcc-5.4. Since
it's based on clang, there should not be any issue compiling projects that
already compile with a recent clang. Even though the speedups are less
interesting on a release build, it is still significantly, especially compared
against clang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really interested in finding out what will be the pricing for zapcc once
out of the beta or if they will be able to get even faster!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the comparison with gcc 4.9.3 and clang 3.7, you can have a look at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2016/11/zapcc-a-faster-cpp-compiler.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just joined the private beta program of zapcc. Zapcc is a c++ compiler, based
on Clang which aims at being much faster than other C++ compilers. How they are
doing this is using a caching server that saves some of the compiler structures,
which should speed up compilation a lot. The private beta is free, but once the
compiler is ready, it will be a commercial compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every C++ developer knows that compilation time can quickly be an issue when
programs are getting very big and especially when working with template-heavy
code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To benchmark this new compiler, I use my Expression Template Library
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl/"&gt;ETL&lt;/a&gt;). This is a purely header-only
library with lots of templates. There are lots of test cases which is what I'm
going to compile. I'm going to compare against Clang-3.7 and gcc-4.9.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have configured zapcc to let is use 2Go RAM per caching server, which is the
maximum allowed. Moreover, I killed the servers before each tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="debug-build"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debug build&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with a debug build. In that configuration, there is no optimization
going on and several of the features of the library (GPU, BLAS, ...) are
disabled. This is the fastest way to compile ETL. I gathered this result on
a 4 core, 8 threads, Intel processor, with an SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following table presents the results with different number of threads and
the difference of zapcc compared to the other compilers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="42%"&gt;
&lt;col width="11%"&gt;
&lt;col width="13%"&gt;
&lt;col width="11%"&gt;
&lt;col width="11%"&gt;
&lt;col width="11%"&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead valign="bottom"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class="head"&gt;Compiler&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;-j1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;-j2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;-j4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;-j6&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;-j8&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;g++-4.9.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;350s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;185s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;104s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;94s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;91s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang++-3.7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;513s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;271s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;153s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;145s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;138s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;zapcc++&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;158s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;87s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;47s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;44s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;42s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Speedup VS Clang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.103&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Speedup VS GCC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is pretty clear! zapcc is around &lt;strong&gt;three times faster than Clang&lt;/strong&gt; and around
&lt;strong&gt;two times faster than GCC&lt;/strong&gt;. This is pretty impressive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that think than Clang is always faster than GCC, keep in mind that
this is not the case for template-heavy code such as this library. In all my
tests, Clang has always been slower and much memory hungrier than GCC on
template-heavy C++ code. And sometimes the difference is very significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, we can also see that going past the physical cores is not really
interesting on this computer. On some computer, the speedups are interesting,
but not on this one. Always benchmark!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="release-build"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Release build&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen the results on a debug build, let's now compare on something a bit
more timely, a release build with all options of ETL enabled (GPU, BLAS, ...),
which should make it significantly longer to compile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="40%"&gt;
&lt;col width="12%"&gt;
&lt;col width="12%"&gt;
&lt;col width="12%"&gt;
&lt;col width="12%"&gt;
&lt;col width="12%"&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead valign="bottom"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class="head"&gt;Compiler&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;-j1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;-j2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;-j4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;-j6&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;-j8&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;g++-4.9.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;628s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;336s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;197s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;189s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;184s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;clang++-3.7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;663s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;388s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;215s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;212s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;205s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;zapcc++&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;515s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;281s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;173s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;168s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;158s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Speedup VS Clang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.38&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Speedup VS GCC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, we can see that the difference is much lower. Zapcc is &lt;strong&gt;between 1.2
and 1.4 times faster than Clang&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;between 1.1 and 1.3 times faster than
GCC&lt;/strong&gt;. This shows that most of the speedups from zapcc are in the front end of
the compiler. This is not a lot but still significant over long builds,
especially if you have few threads where the absolute difference would be
higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also observe that Clang is now almost on par with GCC which shows that
optimization is faster in Clang while front and backend is faster in gcc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also have to keep in mind that zapcc memory usage is higher than Clang
because of all the caching. Moreover, the server are still up in between
compilations, so this memory usage stays between builds, which may not be what
you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for runtime, I have not seen any significant difference in performance
between the clang version and the zapcc. According to the official benchmarks
and documentation, there should not be any difference in that between zapcc and
the version of clang on which zapcc is based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="incremental-build"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Incremental build&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, zapcc should shine at incremental building, but I was unable to show
any speedup when changing a single without killing the zapcc servers. Maybe
I did something wrong in my usage of zapcc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we can see that zapcc is always faster than both GCC and Clang,
on my template-heavy library. Moreover, on debug builds, it is much faster than
any of the two compilers, being more than 2 times faster than GCC and more than
3 times faster than clang. This is really great. Moreover, I have not seen any
issue with the tool so far, it can seamlessly replace Clang without problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a bit weird that you cannot allocate more than 2Go to the zapcc servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a program, that's really impressive. I hope that they are continuing the
good work and especially that this motivates other compilers to improve the
speed of compilation (especially of templates).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more information, you can go to the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.zapcc.com/"&gt;official website of zapcc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(ETL for short): The version 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, I was using a simple rolling release model, but I think it's now time
to switch to some basic versioning. The project is now at a stable state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETL 1.0 has the following main features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart Expression Templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matrix and vector (runtime-sized and compile-time-sized)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple element-wise operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reductions (sum, mean, max, ...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unary operations (sigmoid, log, exp, abs, ...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matrix multiplication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convolution (1D and 2D and higher variations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Max Pooling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast Fourrier Transform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of SSE/AVX to speed up operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of BLAS/MKL/CUBLAS/CUFFT/CUDNN libraries to speed up operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symmetric matrix adapter (experimental)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sparse matrix (experimental)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="examples"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of expressions in ETL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or another I'm using in my neural networks library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code cpp"&gt;&lt;a name="rest_code_0a5ab34ece784181a3df14859b166d3b-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;etl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sigmoid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case, the vector-matrix multiplication will be executed using a BLAS
kernel (if ETL is configured correclty) and the assignment, the sigmoid and the
addition will be automatically vectorized to use either AVX or SSE depending
on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or with a convolutional layer and a ReLU activation function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code cpp"&gt;&lt;a name="rest_code_89ee2406b9dc4d23be6c652cbe9c6c54-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;reshape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;K&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NH1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NH2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;h_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;etl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conv_4d_valid_flipped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;reshape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NV1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NV2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name="rest_code_89ee2406b9dc4d23be6c652cbe9c6c54-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b_rep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will automatically be computed either with NVIDIA CUDNN (if available) or
with optimized SSE/AVX kernels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, you can take a look at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl/wiki"&gt;Reference&lt;/a&gt; on the wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="next-version"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next version, I'll focus on several things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve matrix-matrix multiplication kernels when BLAS is not available. There
is a lot of room for improvement here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete support for symmetric matrices (currently experimental)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe some new adapters such as Hermitian matrices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPU improvements for some operations that can be done entirely on GPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New convolution performanceimprovements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps more complete parallel support for some implementations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop some compiler support to use full C++14 support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="download-etl"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download ETL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download ETL &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl"&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt;. If you
only interested in the 1.0 version, you can look at the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl/releases"&gt;Releases pages&lt;/a&gt; or clone the tag
1.0. There are several branches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; Is the eternal development branch, may not always be stable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt; Is a branch always pointing to the last tag, no development here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the future release, there always will tags pointing to the corresponding
commits. I'm not following the git flow way, I'd rather try to have a more
linear history with one eternal development branch, rather than an useless
develop branch or a load of other branches for releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't hesitate to comment this post if you have any comment on this library or
any question. You can also open an Issue on Github if you have a problem using
this library or propose a Pull Request if you have any contribution you'd like
to make to the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this may be useful to some of you :)&lt;/p&gt;

I'd present the project now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asgard is my project of home automation based on a Raspberry Pi. I started this
project after Ninja Blocks kickstarter company went down and I was left with
useless sensors. So I figured why not have fun creating my own :P I know there
are some other projects out there that are pretty good, but I wanted to do some
more low level stuff for once, so what the hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, everything is written in C++, no surprise here. The project is built
upon a server / drivers architecture. The drivers and the server are talking via
network sockets, so they can be on different machines.  The server is displaying
the data it got on a web interface and also provide a way to trigger actions of
drivers either from the web interface or through the integrated rules engine.
The data are stored in a database, accessed with CPPSqlite3 (probably going to
be replaced by sqlcpp11) and the web server is handled with mongoose (with a c++
interface).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must mention that most of the web part of the project was made by a student of
mine, Stéphane Ly, who work on it as part of his study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of the Raspberry Pi system (not very pretty ;) ):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Asgard automation system hardware" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/asgard_hardware.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to try to fit at least some of it on a nicer box with nicer cables and
such. Moreover, I also plan to add real antennas to the RF transmitter and
receiver, but I haven't received them so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sensors"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sensors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;asgard support several sensors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DHT11 Temperature/Humdity Sensor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WT450 Temperature/Humdity Sensor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RF Button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IR Remote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU Temperature Sensor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the sensors data displayed on the web interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Asgard automation system home page" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/asgard_home.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="actions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently a few actions provided by the drivers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wake-On-Lan a computer by its MAC Address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITT-1500 smart plugs ON and OFF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kodi actions: Pause / Play / Next / Previous on Kodi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the rules engine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Asgard automation system rules page" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/asgard_rules.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-home-automation"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My home automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently using this system to monitor the temperature in my appartment.
Nothing great so far because I don't have enough sensors yet. And now, I'm also
using a wireless button to turn on my power socket, wait 2 seconds and then
power on my Kodi Home Theater with wake on lan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's nothing fancy so far, but it's already better than what I had with Ninja
Blocks, except for the ugly hardware ;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="future"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still tons of work on the project and on integration in my home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm really dissatisfied with the WT450 sensor, I've ordered new Oregon sensors to try to do better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've ordered a few new sensors: Door intrusion detector and motion detector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rules system needs to be improve to support multiple conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I plan to add a simple state system to the asgard server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a lot of refactorings necessary in the code and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I don't know when I'll work on this again, my work on this project is
pretty episodic to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="code"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is, as always, available on Github. There are multiple repositories:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Awichtounet+asgard"&gt;all asgard repositories&lt;/a&gt;.
It's not that much code for now, about 2000 lines of code, but some of it may be
useful. If you plan to use the system, keep in mind that it was never tested out

let's be honest...) and haven't had time to write something here in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, there was too way to use my
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/dll/"&gt;Deep Learning Library (DLL)&lt;/a&gt; project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a C++ program that uses the library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install DLL and write a configuration file to define your network and the problem to solve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first version gives you all the features of the tool and allows you to build
exactly what you need. The second version is a bit more limited, but does not
require any C++ knowledge. However, it still does require a recent C++ compiler
and build system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the high C++ requirements that are not met by Visual Studio and the fact
that I don't work on Windows, this platform is not supported by the tool. Until
now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've added a third option to use DLL in the form of a Docker image to make the
second option even easier and allow the use of DLL on Windows. All you need is
Docker, which is available on Linux, Mac and Windows. This is still limited to
the second option in that you need to write a configuration describing the
network, but you need to build DLL and don't need to install all its
dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="usage"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install the image, you can simply use &lt;cite&gt;docker pull&lt;/cite&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code bash"&gt;&lt;a name="rest_code_e625d849f50c4d5d855cbedb49a99974-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;docker pull wichtounet/docker-dll
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, to run it, you have to create a folder containing a &lt;cite&gt;dll.conf&lt;/cite&gt; file and
mount in the container at &lt;cite&gt;/dll/data/&lt;/cite&gt;. There are some examples in the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/docker-dll/"&gt;image repository&lt;/a&gt;.  For instance,
on Linux from the cloned repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code bash"&gt;&lt;a name="rest_code_1b7be608e6514f2aaf9fc0f1b9204664-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;docker run -v &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/rbm_mnist/:/dll/data/ wichtounet/docker-dll
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;or on Windows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code bash"&gt;&lt;a name="rest_code_02ef74f0eba949c481aec64e07568d48-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;docker run -v /c/Users/Baptiste/rbm_mnist/:/dll/data wichtounet/docker-dll
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will automatically run the actions specified in the configuration file and
train your network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would really have thought this would be harder, but it turned out that Docker
is a very good solution to deploy multiplatform demo tools :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now, there is only support for mnist data format in the tool in this
form, but I plan to add basic CSV support as well in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that this will help people willing to try the library with a simpler
usage.&lt;/p&gt;

Java programs automatically. Since then, this project has evolved a lot and has
now more features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can detect integer overflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect smearing and cancellation with float and double types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect NaN and Infinite results from computations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect offending type casting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, all these features are available without any recompilation of your
program. You simply add an argument to the invocation of the Java virtual
machine and all these errors will be detected for you automatically!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frédéric Bapst, the person in charge of the project has recently published two
videos about the project, don't hesitate to check them out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first video presents the automatic analysis features of the tool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="425" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DqAFQfbWZOU?rel=0&amp;amp;hd=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the second presents the numeric wrapper features of the tool for even more
features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="425" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4x9mJEFjcGc?rel=0&amp;amp;hd=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any question related to the project, you can add a comment to this
page or contact me directly be email.&lt;/p&gt;

Sonarsource proposes a commercial plugins (Views) that allows to do that (and much more...), but I didn't wanted to pay thousands of dollars simply to get a total of my lines of code, therefore I wrote a very  simple Sonar plugin to compute some global metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plugin is very simple, it only provides a global widgets that aggregates some stats over all your projects. For instance, here is the results on my Sonar server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/aggregator_widget.png" class="align-center" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/aggregator_widget.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin is freely available on Github: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/aggregator-plugin"&gt;https://github.com/wichtounet/aggregator-plugin&lt;/a&gt; . However, it has only be tested on my Sonar server (4.5.2) and it is my first Sonar plugin, so it may not work everywhere. If you experience issues, don't hesitate to open an issue on Github or to propose a Pull Request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can install the plugin by putting the .jar file (from the Github Releases page) into your sonar/extensions/plugins directory and restart Sonar. You should then have access to a new global widget that you can add to a dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this plugin helps some of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>projects</category><category>Releases</category><category>Sonar</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2015/11/aggregator-plugin-display-global-metrics-in-sonarqube.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 10:37:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>budgetwarrior 0.3.1 - Git versioning and easier creation</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2014/05/budgetwarrior-031-git-versioning-easier-creation.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've finished a new version of budgetwarrior: budgetwarrior 0.3.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting change is the ability to estimate the date when it is a good time to buy something from the wish list. This is done with the &lt;em&gt;budget wish estimate&lt;/em&gt; command: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="budget wish estimate" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/budget_031_wish_estimate.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This command gives you two dates for each wish in your list. The first is the date wating for each yearly objectives to be fullfilled. The second one considers only the monthly objectives. For now on, no estimation of expenses is made for the future months. It means that the estimation is made as if there were no expenses in the future months. I'll try to improve that by considering averages of expenses in the previous months to make it more reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still on the wish module, you can now mark your wishes as paid instead of deleting them. This helps you keep track of the prices of your wishes. This is done with the &lt;em&gt;budget wish paid id&lt;/em&gt; command. Finally, the totals of the unpaid wishes and of the paid wishes is displayed in &lt;em&gt;budget wish list&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another helpful change is the ability to set a date relative to today's date when creating an expense or an earning. For instance, you can create an expense one month before (-1m) or in one year ((+1y) or yesterday (-1d): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="new date selection mechanism" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/budget_031_date_selection.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can also still set the date manually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last major change is the addition of a new module: &lt;em&gt;budget versioning&lt;/em&gt;. This module helps you manipulate you budget directory with Git. There are two new commands: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;budget versioning save&lt;/em&gt;: Commit the current changes with a default message (Update). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;budget versioning sync&lt;/em&gt;: Pull the changes from the remote directory and push the local changes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will only works if you have already configured your budget directory to use Git. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you'll found these changes interesting :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This version contains several important changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is the addition of a new module to manage objectives. You can add objective with &lt;em&gt;budget objective add). &lt;/em&gt;For instance, you can add an objective saying you want to save 10000$ a year or 200$ a month. When you set your objectives, budget warrior computes how well you complete them. For instance, here is the status of my objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screenshot-from-2014-02-02-113057-e1391337197470.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Objective Status" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screenshot-from-2014-02-02-113057-e1391337197470-300x83.png" title="Objective Status"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another module has been added to manage wishes. You can add wishes to budgetwarrior (&lt;em&gt;budget wish add&lt;/em&gt;) and then budgetwarrior will tell you if it is a good time to buy them. Here is an example of wish status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screenshot-from-2014-02-02-113814.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-2665" alt="Wish Status" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screenshot-from-2014-02-02-113814-e1391337576857-300x96.png" width="300" height="96"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Wish Status&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagnostics tells you where the money will be taken: On savings, on year savings or on month savings (ideal case). It also checks the objectives to see if the payment doesn't break the fulfillment of some of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For complete diagnostics, it is necessary to you register your fortune (&lt;em&gt;budget fortune check&lt;/em&gt;), ideally once a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is only a tool, you should not only use that to decide when to buy something, but it may have a good point of view ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the version also have other smaller changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you make an error when creating a new item (expense, earning, ...), the tool now lets you retry without losing what you typed before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confirmation messages are now shown after each modification command (delete, add and edit).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The license has been changed from Boost to MIT. The sense is almost the same, but the MIT is more well known and I thought it would be easier for people to know what this means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There have several changes to the code base, but that doesn't impact the usage of the tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you'll found these changes interesting :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested by the tool, you can download it on Github: &lt;a title="budgetwarrior repository" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior"&gt;budgetwarrior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've several new features to the tool. First, I've added a graph of the expenses/earnings/balances of each month for a given year in the form of a bar plot. You can see an example in practice here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screenshot-from-2013-10-25-215839.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-2617" alt="budgetwarrior monthly report" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screenshot-from-2013-10-25-215839-300x266.png" width="300" height="266"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing fancy, but it gives a good overview of the current state of your budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've added a new module, called fortune, that lets you enter your total fortune and then computes the difference between the entered fortune statuses. For now, it doesn't do anything else with this data. But in the future, I want to correlate this data with the balances to check the difference between the filled expenses and earnings and the fortune evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also added a more convenient way of creating expenses and earnings. Just type "budget expense add" and you'll be able to fill all the fields one by one. Of course, the command line commands are still available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last new feature I've added is an aggregate report (budget overview aggregate). This view simply groups all the expenses with the same name of a year together. If you always use the same expense title for your groceries, you'll see the total you spent in groceries for a year. You can also name your expenses with the format "Category/Expenses" and all the expenses with the same category will be grouped together in the aggregate view. That allows you to still have enough details in the monthly overview but to logically groups your expenses together in the aggregate view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other changes are minor. I've improved the monthly overview to sort the expenses and earnings by date. To facilitate the storage of the files in a service like Dropbox, the data and configuration files are now only written if they have been modified. The mean in the current overview has been changed to reflect only the months up to the current month and not the future (which was just ruining the means).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested by the tool, you can download it on Github: &lt;a title="budgetwarrior repository" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior"&gt;budgetwarrior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this tool will be useful to some people. If you've any question, just let a comment on this post or contact me directly by email.

Being a huge fan of taskwarrior, I decided to write a kind of similar application for my personal budget, budgetwarrior was born. I use it since two months and I thought that it could be useful for other persons. The application is developed in C++. More information is available on Github: &lt;a title="https://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior"&gt;https://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;budgetwarrior 0.1.0 is a command-line only tool. It works on this principle: you create a set of accounts with a certain limit and then you declare your expenses in each of these accounts. You can also manage earnings that are not each month in each account. You can also keeps track of your debts via this application. It also supports automatic creation of recurring expenses, for instance when you pay the rent (for now, only monthly expenses are supported).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've put all your data in the application, it provides you report on the state of your budget by month or by year. For instance, here is my current monthly report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screenshot-from-2013-08-23-145358.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-2601" title="Monthly Report" alt="Monthly Report" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screenshot-from-2013-08-23-145358-300x95.png" width="300" height="95"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see directly which accounts are in a good shape and which are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the current yearly report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screenshot-from-2013-08-23-145911.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-2602" alt="Yearly report" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screenshot-from-2013-08-23-145911-300x252.png" width="300" height="252"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this view, you can see directly how your accounts evolve during the year and where are your biggest expenses and earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As everything is displayed horizontally, the more accounts you have the larger the view become. With the 7 accounts I have, it takes about 1600 pixels of width to display it. I will try to improve that in the future if some people are interested in making it work on smaller screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Installation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can install budgetwarrior directly from the sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;git clone -b master git://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior.git
cd budgetwarrior
cmake .
make
sudo make install&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, you can use budgetwarrior by using the command &lt;em&gt;budget&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usage is fairly simple, you can use &lt;em&gt;budget help&lt;/em&gt; to have the list of the commands that you have to use to create expenses and earnings and display overviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The project&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any question on the project, don't hesitate to contact me or to post a comment to this post. If there are people interested, I can write a more complete help.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been quite busy finishing my master thesis in february and then taking some vacations in United States, so this version came later than I wanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main change is about the speed of the data-flow optimizations. I refactored a lot the data-flow to make it much faster. Some test cases are up to 10 times faster :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still some work to do for speed of optimizations, but it is much better now. Dead Code Elimination and Constant Propagation still have to be made faster, but now the main bottleneck. In the next version of eddic, the parsing performance will be improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inlining performance has also been greatly improved. The functions are considered in topological order of the call graph. This makes it much faster and moreover the resulting code is more efficient too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some improvements of the language. char and bool types now takes only one byte each. Copy constructors for structures containing field of structure type are now automatically generated. The grammar has been enhanced to support postfix operations in for loops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other improvements have been made to the optimization engine. A new optimization has been implemented: Loop Unswitching. This optimization transforms a code like that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Something&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Something else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In some code like that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Something&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Something else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;when a doesn't depend on the loop body. The body of the loops is much faster in the second version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The induction variable analysis is now able to handle loops with induction variable divided in each iteration. With that new feature, the call: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;is reduced to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;'1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;'2'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;'3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another small optimization is that variables contributing only to themselves are now correctly identified as dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the compiler side, the timing system has been greatly improved to contains almost all part of the compilation process. The timings for the complete compilation is available &lt;a href="https://github.com/wichtounet/eddic/wiki/Performance" title="Performance"&gt;on the wiki&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Future Work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next version of the EDDI compiler (eddic) will be the version 1.2.4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performances will stil be focused for this version. The first change will be to improve the performances of the parsing. Then, I'm gonna try to improve register allocation performances by improving handling of bound registers which I believe is a bottleneck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also several refactorings that I think of doing to the code. I will probably also implement new minor language features, but I still don't know what. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I have to serve in the army the next three weeks, so there won't be any progress these weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Download&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the EDDI Compiler sources on the Github repository: &lt;a title="Github repository of eddic" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/eddic"&gt;https://github.com/wichtounet/eddic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version is available in the &lt;em&gt;v1.2.3&lt;/em&gt; tag available in the GitHub or directly in the &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Compilers</category><category>EDDI</category><category>Optimization</category><category>projects</category><category>Releases</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2013/03/eddic-1-2-3-better-data-flow-analysis.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2013 10:50:27 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
