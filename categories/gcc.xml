The tests are done using GCC 4.7.2 and CLang 3.1 on Gentoo.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Compilation Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I tested has been the compilation time of the two compilers to compile eddic with different flags. I tested the compilation in debug mode and with -O2 and -O3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_0" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_0" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_0(){var graph=new google.visualization.ColumnChart(document.getElementById('graph_0'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['Options','GCC','CLang'],['-g',234.59,119.59],['-O2',273.02,178.22],['-O3',276.87,183.78],]);var options={title:"Compilation Time - Less is better",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},width:'400px',height:'300px',hAxis:{title:"Options"},vAxis:{title:"Seconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_0');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting fact in these results is that CLang is much faster than GCC. It takes twice less times to compile eddic with CLang in debug mode than with GCC. The impact on optimizations on CLang's compilation is also more important than on GCC. For both compilers, -O3 does not seems to add a lot of overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Runtime performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I tested the performance of the generated executable. I tested it on three things, the whole test suite and two test cases that I know are the slowest for the EDDI Compiler. For each case, I took the slowest value of 5 consecutive executions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="graph_1" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="button_graph_1" type="button" value="Logarithmic scale"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;function draw_graph_1(){var graph=new google.visualization.ColumnChart(document.getElementById('graph_1'));var data=google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([['Compiler','GCC -O2','GCC -O3','CLang -O2','CLang -O3'],['testsuite',6.58,6.59,6.74,6.58],['assembly',1.2,1.2,1.2,1.2],['linked_list',0.51,0.5,0.49,0.49],]);var options={title:"Runtime Performance - Less is better",animation:{duration:1200,easing:"in"},width:'600px',height:'400px',hAxis:{title:"Options"},vAxis:{title:"Seconds",viewWindow:{min:0}}};graph.draw(data,options);var button=document.getElementById('button_graph_1');button.onclick=function(){if(options.vAxis.logScale){button.value="Logarithmic Scale";}else{button.value="Normal scale";}options.vAxis.logScale=!options.vAxis.logScale;graph.draw(data,options);};}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference are very small. In -02, GCC performs a bit better, but in -O3, the performance are equivalent. I was a bit disappointed by the results, because I thought that there would be higher differences. It seems that CLang is not as far from GCC that some people would like to say. It also certainly depends on the program being compiled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that CLang is much faster than GCC to compile eddic. Moreover, the performance of the generated executable are almost similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue to use CLang as my development compiler and switches between the two when I'm doing performance benchmarking. I will try to update the benchmark once new versions of GCC / CLang are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current development version can be completely compiled with CLang. Starting with the version 1.1.4, all versions of eddic will be support GCC and CLang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes have not been as painful as I first thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The main problem that I has was about a static const variable of a class that had no user-constructor. GCC allows that, but it is not standard compliant and CLang was complaining. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Another problem that I encountered was about the used of bit flags and Template Meta Programming. I simplified that by the use of a simple type traits and it worked. I don't really know why this does not worked at first. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The remaining effort was to fix the several warnings that CLang had. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLang also fixed a bug in my code with a warning on a assignment that was not supposed to be an assignment, thanks CLang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting fact about CLang is that &lt;strong&gt;is it twice faster to build eddic than GCC&lt;/strong&gt;. I think I'm gonna use it during development to fasten the compile time. Moreover, even if I only worked two days with it, it seems that the error messages are indeed better than the GCC's ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't tried to compare the performances of eddic in both cases, but I will do that in the future, soon after the 1.1.4 version is released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the CLang static analyzer on eddic but it didn't found any bugs. Moreover, it crashed on several of my files. I didn't found why for now, but I will continue to investigate, perhaps I'm not using it correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect to publish the next version of eddic in the next two weeks. This version has much more improvements that I thought at first and I have less time to work now that &lt;a href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2012/09/back-in-berkeley-california/" title="Back in Berkeley, California" target="_blank"&gt;I'm working on my Master thesis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like I did my Bachelor thesis in Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), I will do my Master Thesis there too. The thesis will last a bit less than a semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my Master Thesis I will try to use profiling samples from the Linux perf tools in GCC or Clang to optimize processor cache usage (avoid cache and page faults).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to publish some posts about that during the semester if I have time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Compilers</category><category>Others</category><category>Personal</category><category>The site</category><category>gcc</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2012/09/back-in-berkeley-california.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2012 08:35:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Install the Insight Debugger on Linux Mint (works for Ubuntu too)</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2012/01/install-insight-debugger-linux-mint-ubuntu.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Insight is a very good debugger based on gdb. I prefer it over ddd or kdbg as I find it clearer and easier to use. Moreover, this debugger is also the one used in the book &lt;strong&gt;Assembly language Step by Step, for Linux&lt;/strong&gt;. However, Insight has been removed from Debian packages already more than a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, thanks to SevenMachines, a PPA repository is available to install it on Linux Mint (works also on Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based Linux distributions). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the repository to your apt sources, add the following lines to the /etc/apt/sources.list file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/sevenmachines/dev/ubuntu natty main 
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/sevenmachines/dev/ubuntu natty main &lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and update your apt sources: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can install insight: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install insight&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now you are ready to use Insight as your debugger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't trust this PPA repository, you can also try it to install it from the sources (http://sources.redhat.com/insight/), but doesn't seem to very simple to install it. I wasn't able to build it on my Linux Mint 12.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Assembly</category><category>C++</category><category>Linux</category><category>Mint</category><category>Tools</category><category>gcc</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2012/01/install-insight-debugger-linux-mint-ubuntu.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2012 08:28:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Diploma Thesis : Inlining Assistance for large-scale object-oriented applications</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2011/10/diploma-thesis-inlining-assistance-for-large-scale-object-oriented-applications.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;One month ago, my diploma thesis has been accepted and I got my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made my diploma thesis at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California. I was in the team responsible of the developmenet of the ATLAS Software for the LHC in Cern. The title of my thesis is &lt;strong&gt;Inlining Assistance for large-scale object-oriented applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project was to create a C++ analyzer to find the best functions and call sites to inline. The input of the analyzer is a call graph generated by CallGrind of the Valgrind project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functions and call sites to inline are computed using a heuristic, called the temperature. This heuristic is based on the cost of calling the given function, the frequency of calls and the size of the function. The cost of calling a function is based on the number of parameters, the virtuality of the function and the shared object the function is located in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analyzer is also able to find clusters of call sites. A cluster is a set of hot call sites related to each other. It can also finds the functions that should be moved from one library to the other or the function that should not be virtual by testing the use of each function in a class hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this project, it has been necessary to study in details how a function is called on the Linux platform. The inlining optimization has also been studied to know what were the advantages and the problems of this technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To retrieve the information about the sizes and the virtuality of the function, it has been necessary to read the shared libraries and executables files. For that, we used &lt;em&gt;libelf&lt;/em&gt;. The virtuality of a function is calculated by reading each virtual table and searching for the function in the virtual tables content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graph manipulation is made by the &lt;em&gt;Boost Graph Library&lt;/em&gt;. As it was an advanced library, it has helped me improving my skills in specific topics like templates, traits or Template Metaprogramming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analyzer is able to run on the Linux platform on any program that has been compiled using gcc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that, the package manager doesn't help because not every version of gcc is packaged in every version of Ubuntu. So you must install it by hand and it can take a little time and there is some things that has to be done in order to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm talking here of Ubuntu 11.04 (natty), because this is the version I installed Ubuntu on. This procedure will certainly work but you could have a problem with some dependencies that are installed in natty and not in your version or in the contrary have a dependency already installed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this article will detail every step to install a specific version of gcc &lt;/p&gt;
