&lt;p&gt;The version 0.2.1 contains several bug fixes about archived accounts and bug fixes for budget across several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application as well as the source code is available online: &lt;a href="https://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior"&gt;https://github.com/wichtounet/budgetwarrior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've created Gentoo ebuilds for this application. They are available on my Portage overlay: &lt;a href="https://github.com/wichtounet/portage-overlay"&gt;https://github.com/wichtounet/portage-overlay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gentoo Installation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Edit overlays section of /etc/layman/layman.cfg. Here's an example:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;overlays: http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/repositories.xml
           http://github.com/wichtounet/portage-overlay/raw/master/repository.xml&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Sync layman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;layman -S&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Add the overlay:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;layman -a wichtounet&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Install budgetwarrior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;emerge budgetwarrior&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find any issues with the tool, don't hesitate to post an issue on Github. If you have comments about it, you can post a comment on this post or contact me by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>budgetwarrior</category><category>Gentoo</category><category>Linux</category><category>Tools</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2014/01/budgetwarrior-0-2-1-minor-changes-gentoo-ebuild.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2014 11:41:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Home Server Adventure – Step 3</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2014/01/home-server-adventure-step-3.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some news about my &lt;a title="Home Server Adventure – Step 2" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2013/08/home-server-adventure-step-2/"&gt;home server installation project&lt;/a&gt;.In the past, I already installed a server in a custom Norco case. I wanted to replace my QNAP NAS with a better server, the QNAP being too slow and not extensible enough for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is it how it looks right now (sorry about the photo qualitiy :( my phone does not seem to focus anymore...):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/asdf1.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-2653" alt="My Home Rack of Server" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/asdf1-168x300.png" width="168" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I replaced my QNAP NAS with a custom-built NAS. Again, I bought a NORCO case, the RPC-4220. This case has 20 SATA/SAS bays. I bought it with a replacement of the SAS backplane by a SATA one. I also ordered some fan replacement to make it less noisy. I installed my 6 hard disk in Raid 5, managed with mdadm, with LVM partitions on top of the array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added an APC UPS which allows me to go through all the minor power issues that there is in my old apartment and which also me about 10 minutes of backup when there is a power outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't added a lot of services on the server. I now run Owncloud on the server and that completely replaces my Dropbox account. I also improved by Sabnzbd installation with other newsgroup automation tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not directly related to my rack, but I also installed a custom XBMC server for my TV. It reads from the NAS server. And of course, it runs Gentoo too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, I'll add a new simple server as a front firewall to manage security a bit more than here and avoid having to configure redirection in my shitty router (which I would like to replace, but there are not a lot of compatible rack router for my ISP unfortunately). It will probably use a Norco case too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any question about my build, don't hesitate ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Gentoo</category><category>Hardware</category><category>Home Server</category><category>Server</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2014/01/home-server-adventure-step-3.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2014 12:05:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Gentoo Tips: Avoid Gnome 3.8 from being emerged automatically</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2013/12/gentoo-tips-avoid-gnome-3-8-emerged-automatically.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Gnome 3.8 has been out in the portage tree, a lot of problems arise when you try to emerge something. If it was only when you update the system, it would be OK, but this arises every time you try to install something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if I try to update vim on my system, it tries to update empathy to version 3.8 and then pulls some other dependencies causing blocks and other USE problems. I personally don't think empathy should be emerged when emerging vim. Fortunately, you can disable this behavior by using emerge in this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;emerge --ignore-built-slot-operator-deps=y ...&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, when you emerge vim, it doesn't emerge Gnome 3.8. It is very useful if you want to stay with Gnome 3.6 for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already used this tip several times. I hope that this will be useful to other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Gentoo</category><category>Linux</category><category>Tips</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2013/12/gentoo-tips-avoid-gnome-3-8-emerged-automatically.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2013 05:24:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Home Server Adventure - Step 2</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2013/08/home-server-adventure-step-2.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you remember, I talked about &lt;a title="Home Server Adventure – Step 1" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2013/07/home-server-adventure-step-1/"&gt;my home server project&lt;/a&gt; in a previous post. I had installed an old Dell Poweredge server, a 3com gigabit switch and a monitoring console. The problem with this configuration was that it was too noisy as the rack is installed in my apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was to &lt;a title="ZyXEL GS1910-24 Managed Gigabit Switch Review" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2013/07/zyxel-gs1910-managed-gigabit-switch-review/"&gt;replace my old 3Com switch with a Zyxel managed fanless switch&lt;/a&gt;. Being fanless, this switch is completely silent which makes a good difference :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I have replaced the Dell server with &lt;a title="Norco RPC 230 Case Review" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2013/08/norco-rpc-230-case-review/"&gt;a custom installation in a Norco-RPC 230 case&lt;/a&gt;. The basic case comes with two 80mm fans in the front. These two fans are very powerful, but they are quite noisy. I replaced them with two Enermax T.B. Silence 80mm fans. They are almost silent, it is really great. It is probably not enough airflow for a large configuration, but in my case, I think that this will be largely enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've already installed several services on my server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Tiny Tiny RSS: a web-based news feed reader and aggregator. I use it to replace Feedly which I was getting less and less fond to.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Sabnzbd: I already had this NZB download on my desktop, but now as it is on the server, it can download even when I'm not at home.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Zabbix: a monitoring application that manages all my appliances and server (the new server, the NAS, the switch and the router). It is my first attempt with Zabbix. It is a bit cryptic to conigure, but the features are very numerous.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Teamspeak and Mumble: They already were installed on the previous server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to install new services on the future, but I have no plans for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of the rack in its current state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-23-15.31.45.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-2610" alt="19 Rack" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-23-15.31.45-168x300.jpg" width="168" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also installed my router and the NAS on a layer in the rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't see it, but I have also added to rackable PDU on the back to have to organize a bit the cables. Even if it still not perfect, it is already better than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I think that my system in in good shape. When I will have some more budget, I will replace QNAP NAS with a custom server, probably again with a Norco case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Gentoo</category><category>Hardware</category><category>Home Server</category><category>Server</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2013/08/home-server-adventure-step-2.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2013 07:16:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Norco RPC 230 Case Review</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2013/08/norco-rpc-230-case-review.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As my previous Dell 1U server was &lt;a title="Home Server Adventure – Step 1" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2013/07/home-server-adventure-step-1/"&gt;too noisy for my home server installation&lt;/a&gt;. I invested in a case, a Norco RPC 230 model. This case is a 2U standard case for 19" rack. It supports micro-ATX motherboard and ATX power supply. These components are easy too find, so that makes it a very interesting case for a home server installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered the case at &lt;a title="Ri-Vier Automatisering" href="https://ri-vier.eu/"&gt;Ri-Vier Automatisering&lt;/a&gt;, which is the Norco european distributor. I directly ordered it with the RL-26 rails for the rack and the ATX power supply that is provided by Ri-Vier. For the case, I also bought a micro-ATX Gigabyte G41M-Combo motherboard. I already had 4GB of DDR2 RAM and a Core 2 Duo processor from a previous configuration. I also took my old 120GB Samung SSD for this server. This would be largely sufficient for what I plan to run on this server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case has four 3.5" drive bays and one 5.25" drive bay. The air flow is provided with two 80mm fans on the front panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Package&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received the package very quickly from Ri-Vier. The case is packaged in double box and everything in the package is well ordered. The power supply was already in the box itself. Here is a picture of the content of the package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-09.45.14.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2596" alt="2013-08-20 09.45.14" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-09.45.14-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It contains only the case and the necessary screws. The rails are not on this picture, since I already had installed them in my rack. As you see, there are no manual, which may be a bit frustrating. Once you remove the top panel (4 screws to remove), you can see the inside of the case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-09.54.09.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2595" alt="2013-08-20 09.54.09" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-09.54.09-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the top are the four bays for the drives. They are removable. As you can see on the picture, the power supply has plenty of cables. I would have expected a power supply with less cables to come with this case as there is not much room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a view of the front panel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.11.22.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2593" alt="2013-08-20 11.11.22" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.11.22-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two USB ports on the front, the Power and Reset buttons as well as LEDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Installation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even without any manual, the installation is fairly easy. The top panel can be removed by unscrewing 4 four screws on the side. I strongly recommend to remove the 4 drive bays before installing the other components to make some room. Once it is done, the motherboard can be screwed in place. The power supply is attached by four screws on the back panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed a SSD 2.5" in the leftmost disk bay. I had some issues with this installation as the bays do not have any screws on the side, only on the bottom. They are really not made for anything else than 3.5" drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of my installation once finished:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.11.39.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2592" alt="2013-08-20 11.11.39" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.11.39-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to make it looks nice with the cables, but only because I have not installed any CD-Rom, so I did put a lot of cables in its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it is done, I have installed it in my rack. It is not straightforward without a manual, but I was able to screw it to the rails. I did put two screws on each side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.31.08.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2591" alt="2013-08-20 11.31.08" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.31.08-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in place, it looks quite good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.31.51.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2590" alt="2013-08-20 11.31.51" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.31.51-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I don't know if I have done something wrong, but the rails are not sliding smoothly, they are blocking at two places and the last part is quite hard to push. Anyway, as I won't be moving it a lot, I think it is ok. You also have to remember that even if it is a short depth case, the RL-26 rails are not short at all, they are not made for short depth racks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it is launched, the server is quite busy due to the two 80mm fans. However, the airflow is quite strong, which is what most customers want. It is still more silent than my Dell server, but not enough for a home experience. I will try to replace them with more silent fans in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 13px;"&gt;Enough bays for a simple server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Support standard formats&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Enough air flow&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Very short depth&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Seems of heavy duty construction&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Looks nice&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Not too expensive&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Should fit in most racks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 13px;"&gt;No manuals at all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Disk bays not very convenient&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The provided power supply is not very adapted to the case.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The provided rails seems to not slide smoothly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I would say that this case is very fit to a custom installation as all the components are standards. I would recommend it for a similar usage than mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Gentoo</category><category>Hardware</category><category>Home Server</category><category>Server</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2013/08/norco-rpc-230-case-review.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2013 06:38:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Home Server Adventure - Step 1</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2013/07/home-server-adventure-step-1.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years now, I've almost always had a server running at home. First it was an old desktop computer and then it was a QNAP NAS. The problem with the QNAP is that it is not fast at all and not as flexible as I would like it to be. Moreover, I was also running a Teamspeak server on my desktop for when my friends and I were playing together. So I decided to first install a simple server to replace my teamspeak server and I would services of my NAS with my new server. But this time, I decided to go for the complete option: A 19" rack :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hardware&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I bought all I needed to install my 19" rack at home. I bought everything already used on auctions on Ricardo/Anibis (Switzerland Ebay equivalents) and Ebay. Here is what I got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 13px;"&gt;A 19" inch rack with 40 HE of the mark GURTNER + SCHNIEPP AG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A old Dell Poweredge 1850 server&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A 8-ports Compaq KVM switch&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A monitor/keyboard console for administrating the servers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A 3Com managed Gigabit switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got that for less than 500$. It is probably possible to get a similar configuration for less than that in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some pictures (sorry for the poor quality):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-05-17.58.322.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2568" alt="2013-07-05 17.58.32" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-05-17.58.322-576x1024.jpg" width="576" height="1024"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-05-17.59.232.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2567" alt="2013-07-05 17.59.23" src="http://wichtounet.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-05-17.59.232-576x1024.jpg" width="576" height="1024"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it is kind of empty. I will also put my NAS and my internet provider router in the rack in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A this time, the cables are not very good organized, I will try to purchase some guides to make that look better and I will also try to find a rack PDU to distribute power without cables everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also need to find two 120mm fans for the top of my case to improve air circulation. Very quiet 120mm can be found, so noise won't be a problem I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, I also plan to find an UPS, but they are very expensive, so I will continue looking at auctions for them. The problem being that the battery should not be too old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Software&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I've installed Gentoo on the server. At first, I wanted to install a Gentoo Hardened distribution with Selinux, but it turned out that it was too much of a hassle. After more than 10 hours of trying to make it work, I started again and in less than two hours my Gentoo installation was working. I will probably try again in the future, at least to harden the server and I hope it will go with less problems. The server is of course gui-less, only console access is more than sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now on, I have only a Teamspeak server and a Mumble server installed on the server, but I plan to add new services on it, Sabnzb for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also installed iptables to add some layer of protection, even if I don't think that it is necessary in my case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I used dyndns to map my public ip to a domain name to make it easier to reach. For now, I haven't installed an update client, but I plan to try ddclient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Problems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made some mistake when choosing the components for my installation. First of all, they are too noisy. The server and the switch are a real problem. They are both made for professional installations. Generally 1U server have very small fans (40mm generally) which are very noisy. So I decided to upgrade my configurations with two changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 13px;"&gt;I will buy a fanless switch, probably unmanaged. They are plenty of very good fanless switches, even managed one for a reasonable price. I will try to first find a used one on auction, but I may consider buying a new one, as there exists some for about a hundred dollars. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I will replace the Dell server with a custom server. I found some very good cases made by Norco. I'll buy a Micro ATX motherboard and install my old computer configuration (&lt;a title="Why and how I completely left Windows for Linux" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2013/07/why-how-left-windows-for-linux/"&gt;the one I had before&lt;/a&gt;) on it. It won't cost too much I think, although much more than the 30$ Dell server I have now ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem being that the Dell server is too deep for my rack, so I can't close the back part as you can see on the pictures, but replacing it with the Norco case will solve the problem :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might sound crazy to have a complete rack at home, but I thing that it is a great way to experience with servers and network. It is also quite practical if you plan to have several servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to post some posts on the subject on the future, so I hope  that it interests some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Gentoo</category><category>Hardware</category><category>Home Server</category><category>Network</category><category>Server</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2013/07/home-server-adventure-step-1.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2013 07:02:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Why and how I completely left Windows for Linux</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2013/07/why-how-left-windows-for-linux.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years now, I always kept a dual-boot at home with a Linux system (currently Gentoo) and a Windows system. At work, I only use Gentoo. This week-end, I decided to completely remove it and migrate the applications I used on Windows to my Gentoo system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why Windows ?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first things first, why was I keeping the Windows system ? For several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Games :) Unfortunately, most of the games I play are not natively compatible with Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Office. I always liked Microsoft Office. As I hate OpenOffice/LibreOffice, I never wanted to remove it For schools we always had several teachers forcing us to use Microsoft document formats.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Hardware support. I always found that hardware support in Windows was great. Most of the time when you add new peripheral, there is nothing, it just works, which is great.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Applications. I always had some applications that I didn't found good enough Linux equivalents for. For instance, Newsleecher, iTunes or TaggedFrog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I work on Linux for years now and I would like to have to work on Windows again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What Changed ?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend I upgraded my hardware configuration (Motherboard, CPU and RAM). I was afraid that I had to reinstall my Linux configurations (because of Gentoo compiled with march=native), but I never thought that I would have to reinstall Windows. I turned out the contrary: my Gentoo installation worked just fine and my Windows totally crashed (BSOD at each startup). I finally made it through Windows after disabled AHCI mode on my motherboard, but then activation was invalidated (of course...) and online activation was not working. I decided to install the new chipset drivers and launch the Windows update and after that, Windows decided to boot without any USB support (WTF...). After that, I decided that Windows what not so great at all for   hardware support...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason I left Windows is Windows 8. I find that Window 7 was really great, but I really don't like Windows 8 and I would never have upgraded my Seven to it. Moreover, I recently bought Microsoft Office 2013 and it turned that I had to create an account at Microsoft to install it... Seriously ??? And moreover, it turned out to be worse thant Office 2010 (which, again, was great).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all these reasons made me remove Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to migrate everything to Linux ?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I had no problem with my data. Most of my data are on a personal NAS and the remaining is on Dropbox, so no problem on this side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still had some problems to resolve. First of all, I needed my games to run on Linux. I currently play only Diablo III. As I had received a year free of &lt;a title="Crossover" href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/"&gt;Crossover&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to give it a try. Crossover is based on Wine and ensures that some software are running correctly under it and provide technical support. After some tuning, Diablo III was running almost flawlessly on my Gentoo machine :) Problem 1 solved. I will totally buy a license of Crossover, once my free year is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still add some applications to replace. I use iTunes as my main music player and library manager. Some time ago, I tried a lot of programs like Amarok/Rythmbox/Banshee, but I didn't liked them a lot and they were not running very well on large library of music files. This time, I tried &lt;a title="Clementine" href="http://www.clementine-player.org/"&gt;Clementine&lt;/a&gt;. Even if not very beautiful, it had all the features I needed and worked very well. I decided to stick with it. Another program I like a lot on Windows is TaggedFrog. It is a very simple program allowing to put tags on any file on the system and then search by tag on them. I haven't found a total equivalent. I first tried Tracker that is a Gnome project, but I was not satisfied with the search interface. After that, I tried the very simple &lt;a title="TMSU" href="http://tmsu.org/"&gt;TMSU&lt;/a&gt;. It is a command-line based tagging manager. All the tagging must be done in command line. In my case, it is not a problem, as I don't mind using the command-line and I don't tag files very often. What is very interesting about TMSU is that it can create a virtual file system (based on FUSE). In this file system, you have all your tags  as folder and you can see directly all the files of each tag. Moreover, you can directly make cross search (has tag X and Y and Z) by just going down in the tag folder. It is really great and has everything I needed. Finally, I also needed something to replace Newsleecher. I haven't found something as great (especially no replacement for the Supersearch function), but I installed &lt;a title="Sabnzbd" href="http://sabnzbd.org/"&gt;Sabnzbd&lt;/a&gt; which works really well and is very simple. For now, I just use the web interface and haven't installed any other front-end, but that will perhaps change in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't replaced Office for now on. It occurred to me that since I left school, I haven't used it a lot, so that will probably not be a problem anymore. I will change to write the few letters I have to write on Latex and if I have Office documents, I'll probably read them on Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I lost a lot of time with all that, I think it is a great think. It makes one less configuration to maintain and some less costs on the future. Moreover, I will save some time, because I won't have to switch between Linux and Windows for different tasks. And now, I have a second SSD ready for something else, either for RAID 1 to ensure redundancy on Linux or to mount on a server, I'll see later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will probably have some more problems in the future, but I'm convinced that there will be Linux solutions to it :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Gentoo</category><category>Linux</category><category>Others</category><category>Personal</category><category>Windows</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2013/07/why-how-left-windows-for-linux.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 06:24:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Install Valgrind on Gentoo Linux</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2012/04/install-valgrind-on-gentoo-linux.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valgrind&lt;/strong&gt; is very powerful suite of software for dynamic analysis of binary programs. Valgrind is available in an ebuild on the Gentoo portage tree, but if you want to install valgrind on your Gentoo distribution, there is a problem with the build with the standard library. On Gentoo, the standard C library (glibc) is stripped and Valgrind needs the debug symbols to work. If you try to launch valgrind without the debug symbols, you will get the following error: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;valgrind:  Fatal error at startup: a function redirection
valgrind:  which is mandatory for this platform-tool combination
valgrind:  cannot be set up.  Details of the redirection are:
valgrind:  
valgrind:  A must-be-redirected function
valgrind:  whose name matches the pattern:      strlen
valgrind:  in an object with soname matching:   ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
valgrind:  was not found whilst processing
valgrind:  symbols from the object with soname: ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
valgrind:  
valgrind:  Possible fixes: (1, short term): install glibc's debuginfo
valgrind:  package on this machine.  (2, longer term): ask the packagers
valgrind:  for your Linux distribution to please in future ship a non-
valgrind:  stripped ld.so (or whatever the dynamic linker .so is called)
valgrind:  that exports the above-named function using the standard
valgrind:  calling conventions for this platform.
valgrind:  
valgrind:  Cannot continue -- exiting now.  Sorry.&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first, you have to activate the debug symbols for the libraries in your &lt;em&gt;/etc/make.conf&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;FEATURES="splitdebug"&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you can emerge again the glibc: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;sudo emerge glibc&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already had emerged valgrind, there is no need to emerge it again, it should work now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, you can emerge valgrind: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;sudo emerge valgrind&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And everything will work fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Gentoo</category><category>Linux</category><category>Tools</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2012/04/install-valgrind-on-gentoo-linux.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Apr 2012 06:57:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Switching to Gentoo Linux</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2012/04/switching-gentoo-linux.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After having switched to Mint from Ubuntu, I'm on the verge of switching to &lt;strong&gt;Gentoo Linux&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentoo is a powerful operating system base on Linux. This operating system provides extreme configurability and performance. Gentoo is very lightweight on its own, by default, there is not even a window manager installed. A big advantage of this system is that you can customize your system to your exact needs. You can use it as a server, a desktop distribution or whatever you needs. You install only the program you needs. This advantage leads to an inconvenient: you will need an advanced knowledge on Linux to install your system. Indeed, you will have to configure your kernel, choose compilation flags, choose your packages carefully and know your hardware as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentoo is based on a very powerful software distribution system, &lt;strong&gt;Portage&lt;/strong&gt;. Portage is used to install new packages, get the latest software for Gentoo or upgrade your system. Except for some proprietary software, all the packages are built from the sources. This allow to a deep customization of your software. The installation of some package can take a big amount of time to compile. Count at least several hours to install a system based on Gnome Shell for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you plan to install a full installation of Gentoo, reserve some days for that. I've spent several days working on my installation before getting to something fully working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my current configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Gentoo operating system&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Linux Kernel 3.3&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Gnome Shell 3.2.1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Google Chrome 18&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;NVidia Drivers 295.33&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I've stripped my kernel and my init scripts to the maximum, my boot time is much faster and my installation takes much less space than my Mint installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said that I'm on the verge of switching because I still have some applications that are not installed on my new Gentoo distribution. For example, I have no multimedia support for now, but I already spent most of my time on my new distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to write some posts on Gentoo in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Gentoo</category><category>Linux</category><category>Mint</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2012/04/switching-gentoo-linux.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2012 07:28:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Linux Kernel Tip : Do not disable System V IPC for X.Org and Chrome</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2012/04/linux-kernel-tip-do-not-disable-system-v-ipc-for-x-org-and-chrome.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I recompiled my Linux Kernel stripping it again and I found out that X.org was not working very anymore.
