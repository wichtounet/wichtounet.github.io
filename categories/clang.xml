The tests are done using GCC 4.7.2 and CLang 3.1 on Gentoo.
&lt;h3&gt;Compilation Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I tested has been the compilation time of the two compilers to compile eddic with different flags. I tested the compilation in debug mode and with -O2 and -O3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bar_chart width="400px" height="300px" title="Compilation Time - Less is better" h_title="Options" v_title="Seconds" scale_button="true"]
          ['Options', 'GCC', 'CLang'],
          ['-g',  234.59,   119.59],
          ['-O2',  273.02,   178.22],
          ['-O3',  276.87,   183.78],
[/bar_chart]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting fact in these results is that CLang is much faster than GCC. It takes twice less times to compile eddic with CLang in debug mode than with GCC. The impact on optimizations on CLang's compilation is also more important than on GCC. For both compilers, -O3 does not seems to add a lot of overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Runtime performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I tested the performance of the generated executable. I tested it on three things, the whole test suite and two test cases that I know are the slowest for the EDDI Compiler. For each case, I took the slowest value of 5 consecutive executions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bar_chart width="600px" height="400px" title="Runtime Performance - Less is better" h_title="Options" v_title="Seconds" scale_button="true"]
          ['Compiler', 'testsuite', 'assembly', 'linked_list'],
          ['GCC -O2',  6.58,   1.2, 0.51],
          ['GCC -O3',  6.59,   1.2, 0.5],
          ['CLang -O2',  6.74,   1.2, 0.49],
          ['CLang -O3',  6.58,   1.2, 0.49],
[/bar_chart]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference are very small. In -02, GCC performs a bit better, but in -O3, the performance are equivalent. I was a bit disappointed by the results, because I thought that there would be higher differences. It seems that CLang is not as far from GCC that some people would like to say. It also certainly depends on the program being compiled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that CLang is much faster than GCC to compile eddic. Moreover, the performance of the generated executable are very similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue to use CLang as my development compiler and switches between the two when I'm doing performance benchmarking. I will try to update the benchmark once new versions of GCC / CLang are available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Benchmarks</category><category>CLang</category><category>Compilers</category><category>EDDI</category><category>EDDI</category><category>gcc</category><category>Performances</category><guid>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2012/11/gcc-4-7-clang-3-1-eddic.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Nov 2012 09:28:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>eddic compiles with CLang 3.1</title><link>http://wichtounet.github.io/posts/2012/11/eddic-compiles-with-clang-3-1.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally added support for compiling eddic with LLVM CLang 3.1 !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current development version can be completely compiled with CLang. Starting with the version 1.1.4, all versions of eddic will be support GCC and CLang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes have not been as painful as I first thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The main problem that I has was about a static const variable of a class that had no user-constructor. GCC allows that, but it is not standard compliant and CLang was complaining. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Another problem that I encountered was about the used of bit flags and Template Meta Programming. I simplified that by the use of a simple type traits and it worked. I don't really know why this does not worked at first. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The remaining effort was to fix the several warnings that CLang had. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLang also fixed a bug in my code with a warning on a assignment that was not supposed to be an assignment, thanks CLang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting fact about CLang is that &lt;strong&gt;is it twice faster to build eddic than GCC&lt;/strong&gt;. I think I'm gonna use it during development to fasten the compile time. Moreover, even if I only worked two days with it, it seems that the error messages are indeed better than the GCC's ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't tried to compare the performances of eddic in both cases, but I will do that in the future, soon after the 1.1.4 version is released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the CLang static analyzer on eddic but it didn't found any bugs. Moreover, it crashed on several of my files. I didn't found why for now, but I will continue to investigate, perhaps I'm not using it correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect to publish the next version of eddic in the next two weeks. This version has much more improvements that I thought at first and I have less time to work now that &lt;a href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2012/09/back-in-berkeley-california/" title="Back in Berkeley, California" target="_blank"&gt;I'm working on my Master thesis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
