I have had quite a lot of work between my Ph.D and my teaching. I have several projects going on, I'll try to write updates on them later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I wrote an article &lt;cite&gt;about the official C++ plugin for Sonar &amp;lt;http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2014/10/sonarqube-inspections-for-cpp-projects.html&amp;gt;&lt;/cite&gt;. I was quite disappointed by the quality of a plugin. I was expecting more from an expensive official plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an open-source alternative to the commercial plugin: &lt;cite&gt;sonar-cxx-plugin &amp;lt;https://github.com/wenns/sonar-cxx&amp;gt;&lt;/cite&gt;. I already tested it quite some time ago (a development version of the 0.9.1 version) and the results were quite bad. I'm using C++11 and C++14 in almost all of my projects and the support was quite bad at that time. Happily, this support has now gotten much better :) In this article, I'll talk about the version 0.9.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="usage"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usage of this plugin is very easy, you don't need any complicated build wrapping techniques for it. You simply need to complete a &lt;em&gt;sonar-project.properties&lt;/em&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
sonar.projectKey=etl
sonar.projectName=etl
sonar.projectVersion=1.0

sonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8
sonar.sources=include,test,workbench
sonar.language=c++
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, you simply have to use &lt;em&gt;sonar-runner&lt;/em&gt; as for any other Sonar project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
sonar-runner&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the analysis will be run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't had any issues with the analysis. However, the plugin is not yet completely C++11/C++14 compatible, therefore I'm encountering a lot of parser errors during the analysis. When an error is encountered by the parser, the line is skipped and the parser goes to the next line. This means that the analysis of the line is incomplete, which may lead to false positives or to missing issues. This comes from that sonar-cxx uses its own parser, which is to on par with clang-compatible parsers for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the Sonar summary of my ETL project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/sonar_summary.png" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/sonar_summary.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="inspections"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inspections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plugin supports some inspections on itself. Nevertheless, you have to enable since it seems that most of them are disable by default. Code duplication is also automatically generated during the analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/sonar_duplicated.png" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/sonar_duplicated.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The philosophy of this project is not to develop all inspections, but to integrate with other tools. For instance, cppcheck is already supported and the integration works perfectly. Here are the tools that sonar-cxx supports for quality analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cppcheck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;valgrind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vera++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RATS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PC-Lint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have only tested cppcheck for now. I plan to use valgrind running on my tests in the future. I don't plan to use the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that the plugin supports compiler warnings coming from G++ and Visual Studio. I don't use this since I compile all my projects with -Werror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest absent here is Clang, there is no support for its warnings, its static-analyzer or its advanced clang-tidy tool. If clang-tidy support does not come in the near future, I'm planning to try to add it myself, provided I find some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have to some inspections on one of my project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/sonar_inspections.png" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/sonar_inspections.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any Sonar projects, you have access to the Hotsposts view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/sonar_hotspots.png" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/sonar_hotspots.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="unit-tests-integration"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unit Tests Integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been able to integrate my unit tests results inside Sonar. The plugin expects JUnit compatible format. Several of C++ unit test libraries already generates compatible format. In my case, I used Catch and it worked very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is even more interesting is the support for code coverage. You have to run your coverage-enabled executable and then use gcovr to generate an XML file that the plugin can read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This support works quite well. The only thing I haven't been able to make work is the execution time computation of the unit tests, but that is not something I really care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the coverage results for one of my files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/sonar_coverage.png" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/sonar_coverage.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support of a lot of external tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very easy to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duplicated code analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very good code coverage analysis integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too few integrated inspections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited parsing of C++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not fully compatible with C++11/C++14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;False positives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not enough love for clang (compiler warnings, clang-tidy, tooling, static-analyzer, ...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provided metrics are really good, the usage is quite simple and this plugin supports some external tools adding interesting inspections. Even if this plugin is not perfect, it is a very good way to do Continuous Quality Analysis of your C++ projects. I personally find it superior to the official plugin. The usage is more simple (no build-wrapper that does not work), it supports more external tools and supports JUnit reports. On the other hand, it has much less integrated inspections and rely more on external tools. Both have problems with modern C++ features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would really like in this plugin is the support of the clang-tidy analyzer (and other Clang analysis tools) and also complete C++11/C++14 support. I honestly think that the only way to fix the latter is to switch to Clang parsing with libtooling rather than developing an in-house parser, but that is not up to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will definitely continue to use this plugin to generate metrics for my C++ projects. I use it with Jenkins which launch the analysis every time I push to one my git repositories. This plugin definitely shows promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>C++</category><category>Review</category><category>Sonar</category><category>Tools</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2015/05/sonar-cpp-community-plugin-review.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 May 2015 15:09:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>SonarQube inspections for C++ projects</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2014/10/sonarqube-inspections-for-cpp-projects.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the days, when I used to develop in Java (I hadn't discovered the
wonders of C++ :) ), I used Sonar a lot for my projects. Sonar is a great tool
for quality inspections of a project. Sonar has been made for Java and is mostly
free and opensource (some plugins are commercial) to inspect Java projects.
Unfortunately, this is not the case for C++ inspection. Indeed, the C++ plugin
cost 7000 euros (more than 8500$). As I mostly work on C++ for opensource and
school projects, I'm definitely not able to buy it. I wanted for a long time to
test the commercial C++ plugin. For this article, sonarsource provided me with a
short (very short) time license for the C++ plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also another option for C++ which is the C++ community plugin:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wenns/sonar-cxx"&gt;https://github.com/wenns/sonar-cxx&lt;/a&gt;. I have tested it some time ago, but I was
not satisfied with it, I had several errors and had to use a dev version to make
it work a bit. Moreover, the C++11 support is inexistant and management of
parsing error is not really satisfying. But maybe it is good for you. This
article will only focus on the commercial plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="usage"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each project that you want to analyze with Sonar, you have to create a
sonar-project.properties files describing some basic information about your
project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there are two ways to inspect a C++ project. The first one and recommended
one is to use the &lt;em&gt;build-wrapper&lt;/em&gt; executable. It is a sub project that you have
to download and install alongside Sonar. It works by wrapping the commands to
your build systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
build-wrapper make all
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this should generate enough informations for not having to fill each field
in the project configuration. The, you have to use the &lt;em&gt;sonar-runner&lt;/em&gt; program to
upload to Sonar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried it on several projects and there seems to be a problem with the
includes. It didn't include the header files in the Sonar inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally ended up using manual configuration of the Sonar project and the
header files were included correctly. However, you normally have to include many
information in the configuration including all macros for instance. For now, I
haven't bothered generating them and it doesn't seem to impact too much the
results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I look in the log, it seems that there are still a lot of parsing errors.
They seem mostly related to some compiler macro, especially the __has_feature__
macro of clang. This is the same problem with the build-wrapper. When I don't
use the build-wrapper I also have other problems with macros for unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have other errors coming during the inspection, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
error directive: This file requires compiler and library support for the ISO C++
2011 standard. This support is currently experimental, and must be enabled with
the -std=c++11 or -std=gnu++11 compiler options
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it comes from the fact that I compile with std=c++1y and that Sonar
does not support C++14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="inspections"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inspections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the results of inspection on my ETL project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/etl_dashboard.png" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/etl_dashboard.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like the web interface of Sonar, it really sums well all the
information and the various plugins play quite nice with each other. Moreover,
when you check issues, you can see directly the source code very clearly. I
really think this is the strong point of Sonar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the Hotspots view for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/etl_dashboard.png" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/etl_dashboard.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the Time Machine view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/etl_dashboard.png" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/etl_dashboard.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues that are reported by Sonar are quite good. On this project there is a
lot of them related to naming conventions because I don't follow the conventions
configured by default. However, you can easily configure the inspections to give
your own naming regex or simple enable/disable some inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some good inspections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some missing explicit keyword&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some commented block of code that can be removed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An if-elseif construct that should have had a else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Files with too high complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are also some important false positives. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/etl_false_positive_1.png" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/etl_false_positive_1.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In here, there are no reasons to output this issue since the operator is
deleted. It proves that the C++11 support is rather incomplete. I have other
false positives of the same kind for &lt;em&gt;= default&lt;/em&gt; operators and constructors.
Here is another example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/etl_false_positive_2.png" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/etl_false_positive_2.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the varadic template support is mixed with the old ellipsis
notation, making it again a lack of C++11 support. There are also other false
positives for instance because of lambdas, but all of them were related to
C++11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="various"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Various&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't think you have enough quality rules, you can also include the one
from cppcheck simply by givin the path to cppcheck in sonar-project.properties.
I think this is great, since it works all by itself. You can also create your
own rule, but you'll have to use XPath for path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want, you can also include unit test reports inside Sonar. I haven't
tested this support since they only support cppunit test reports and I use only
Catch for my unit tests. It would have been great if JUnit format would have
been supported since many tool support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last option that is supported by this plugin is the support of GCOV reports
for code coverage information. I haven't been able to make it work, I had errors
indicating that the source files were not found. I didn't figure this out. It
may come from the fact that I used llvm and clang to generate the GCOV reports
and not G++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, here are some pros and cons for the C++ support in SonarQube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good default inspections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great web interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cppcheck very well integrated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issues are easily configurable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C++11 support is incomplete and no C++14 support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build-wrapper support seems instable. It should be integrated directly into
sonar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit tests support is limited to cppunit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Haven't been able to make Code Coverage work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macro support not flexible enough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too expensive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quite complicated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No support for other static analyzer than cppcheck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general web interface feeling is quite good, everything looks great and the
report are really useful. However, the usage of the tool does not feel very
professional. I had a lot more problems than I expected to use it. I was also
really disappointed by the C++11. The syntax seems to be supported but not the
language feature in the inspections, making the C++11 support completely
useless. This is weird since they cite C+11 as supported. Moreover, there not
yet any C++14 support, but this is less dramatic. It is also a bit sad that they
limit the import to cppcheck and no other static analyzers and the same stands
for cppunit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it is really an inferior product compared to the Java support.
I was expecting more from a 8500 dollars product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I won't probably use it anymore on my projects since all of them use at
least C++11, but I will probably retry Sonar for C++ in the future hoping that
it will become as the Sonar Java support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>C++</category><category>Review</category><category>Sonar</category><category>Tools</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2014/10/sonarqube-inspections-for-cpp-projects.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2014 12:55:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ri-Vier RV 2004 Rackmount case Review</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2014/05/ri-vier-rv-2004-rackmount-case-review.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ordered a new rackmount case for my third server at home. Previously, I only used Norco cases, but the European distributor of Norco (Ri-vier, Netherlands) decided to switch to using its own cases, the Ri-vier cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the shipping fees are very expensive from United States to Switzerland, I decided to stick with Ri-vier for now and try their new cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered and received the RV-2004 case. This is a 2U case with one 5.25" and 4 3.5". It is a very short case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The case&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of the case: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="RV-2004 case" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/RVS-2004_1_LRG.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks quite good actually and very like the Norco equivalents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the front: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="RV-2004 case front view" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/RVS-2004_4_LRG.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can put a DVD reader on front. There are also two USB ports and several leds. I really don't like the front panel. There a lot of screws that maintain the front panel. Moreover, the part with the buttons and the LEDs is quite hard to put right and seems of really low facture, I haven't been able to make the LEDs work as of now. The buttons have a kind of plastic cap on them, but it is very hard to make them stay on the buttons when you install the front panel. Finally, there are two fans on the front on their own panel. You can remove the fans, but they are so close together, that most silent fans you will buy won't fit side by side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And an inner view: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="RV-2004 case inner view" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/images/RVS-2004_7_LRG.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three hard disk top cases are removable. In my case, I only left one of them for the SSD. The rightmost one is very hard to pull in and out. I don't understand why there are only three removable cases. The fourth disk location cannot be moved. As with all other cases, it it not very practical to install a SSD in it. I ended up screwing the SSD on top of one of the removable bays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without any media drive and only one SSD, there are plenty of space inside the case to put the cables. Even with all the bays used, there would probably be some space left under the drive bays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mouting the motherboard inside the case was really easy, nothing special here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is only mountable with RVR-20 rails, not with the Norco RL rails. These rails are really worse than the Norco rails. There are extensible, being in three parts, but the extension is not as good as Norco's. If you extend the rails, you have to mount the rails close to the rear of the case. Moreover, the clip on rails to unblock them does not seem to work on my rails. Fortunately, that is not a case I intend to upgrade in the future, so I should not use the rails extensively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enough room on the inside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looks quite nice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fans too close to each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Front panel very cheaply built&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Front panel hard to put correctly in place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the removable hard drive internal bays is very hard to move&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very poor rails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish, I would say that I'm kind of disappointed with this case. It really feels worse than the Norco equivalent. I'd rather have Norco cases again. The only advantage it has over the Norco one is being cheaper. I'm probably gonna go for a Norco case again for my next server. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Hardware</category><category>Home Server</category><category>Review</category><category>Server</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2014/05/ri-vier-rv-2004-rackmount-case-review.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2014 11:40:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Norco RPC 230 Case Review</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2013/08/norco-rpc-230-case-review.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As my previous Dell 1U server was &lt;a title="Home Server Adventure – Step 1" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2013/07/home-server-adventure-step-1/"&gt;too noisy for my home server installation&lt;/a&gt;. I invested in a case, a Norco RPC 230 model. This case is a 2U standard case for 19" rack. It supports micro-ATX motherboard and ATX power supply. These components are easy too find, so that makes it a very interesting case for a home server installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered the case at &lt;a title="Ri-Vier Automatisering" href="https://ri-vier.eu/"&gt;Ri-Vier Automatisering&lt;/a&gt;, which is the Norco european distributor. I directly ordered it with the RL-26 rails for the rack and the ATX power supply that is provided by Ri-Vier. For the case, I also bought a micro-ATX Gigabyte G41M-Combo motherboard. I already had 4GB of DDR2 RAM and a Core 2 Duo processor from a previous configuration. I also took my old 120GB Samung SSD for this server. This would be largely sufficient for what I plan to run on this server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case has four 3.5" drive bays and one 5.25" drive bay. The air flow is provided with two 80mm fans on the front panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Package&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received the package very quickly from Ri-Vier. The case is packaged in double box and everything in the package is well ordered. The power supply was already in the box itself. Here is a picture of the content of the package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-09.45.14.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2596" alt="2013-08-20 09.45.14" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-09.45.14-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It contains only the case and the necessary screws. The rails are not on this picture, since I already had installed them in my rack. As you see, there are no manual, which may be a bit frustrating. Once you remove the top panel (4 screws to remove), you can see the inside of the case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-09.54.09.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2595" alt="2013-08-20 09.54.09" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-09.54.09-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the top are the four bays for the drives. They are removable. As you can see on the picture, the power supply has plenty of cables. I would have expected a power supply with less cables to come with this case as there is not much room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a view of the front panel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.11.22.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2593" alt="2013-08-20 11.11.22" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.11.22-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two USB ports on the front, the Power and Reset buttons as well as LEDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Installation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even without any manual, the installation is fairly easy. The top panel can be removed by unscrewing 4 four screws on the side. I strongly recommend to remove the 4 drive bays before installing the other components to make some room. Once it is done, the motherboard can be screwed in place. The power supply is attached by four screws on the back panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed a SSD 2.5" in the leftmost disk bay. I had some issues with this installation as the bays do not have any screws on the side, only on the bottom. They are really not made for anything else than 3.5" drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of my installation once finished:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.11.39.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2592" alt="2013-08-20 11.11.39" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.11.39-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to make it looks nice with the cables, but only because I have not installed any CD-Rom, so I did put a lot of cables in its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it is done, I have installed it in my rack. It is not straightforward without a manual, but I was able to screw it to the rails. I did put two screws on each side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.31.08.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2591" alt="2013-08-20 11.31.08" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.31.08-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in place, it looks quite good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.31.51.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2590" alt="2013-08-20 11.31.51" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-08-20-11.31.51-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I don't know if I have done something wrong, but the rails are not sliding smoothly, they are blocking at two places and the last part is quite hard to push. Anyway, as I won't be moving it a lot, I think it is ok. You also have to remember that even if it is a short depth case, the RL-26 rails are not short at all, they are not made for short depth racks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it is launched, the server is quite busy due to the two 80mm fans. However, the airflow is quite strong, which is what most customers want. It is still more silent than my Dell server, but not enough for a home experience. I will try to replace them with more silent fans in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 13px;"&gt;Enough bays for a simple server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Support standard formats&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Enough air flow&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Very short depth&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Seems of heavy duty construction&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Looks nice&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Not too expensive&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Should fit in most racks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 13px;"&gt;No manuals at all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Disk bays not very convenient&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The provided power supply is not very adapted to the case.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The provided rails seems to not slide smoothly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I would say that this case is very fit to a custom installation as all the components are standards. I would recommend it for a similar usage than mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Gentoo</category><category>Hardware</category><category>Home Server</category><category>Review</category><category>Server</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2013/08/norco-rpc-230-case-review.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2013 06:38:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>ZyXEL GS1910-24 Managed Gigabit Switch Review</title><link>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2013/07/zyxel-gs1910-managed-gigabit-switch-review.html</link><dc:creator>Baptiste Wicht</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A short time ago, &lt;a title="Home Server Adventure – Step 1" href="http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2013/07/home-server-adventure-step-1/"&gt;I decided to install servers in a rack at my home&lt;/a&gt;. Although working very well, my 3Com managed was too much noisy for being at home. That is why I decided to change it for fanless switch. After some research, I finally chose a ZyXEL GS1910-24. It is a web-manageable gigabit switch. I chose the 24 ports version. This version has also 4 SFPs that replace 4 normal ports if enabled. I don't think I will ever need the SFPs, but it is nice to know that there are here if necessary. This switch has a lot of cool features, it supports IPV6, QoS, VLANs, filtering, RADIUS and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The package&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package does not contains a lot of things, but does contain the essential:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 13px;"&gt;The switch itself&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A power code&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Rack mounting brackets and screws&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Manuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture on the package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-11-16.51.47.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2574" alt="2013-07-11 16.51.47" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-11-16.51.47-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The switch is really small, twice narrower than my 3Com switch and more than twice lighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing special to say about the package, it is neatly done and has everything that is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Installation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation inside a rack is really easy. Each bracket is mounted with 4 screws onto the switch and then two screws are holding each bracket into place in the rack. Here is a picture of the rack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-11-17.07.00.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2575" alt="2013-07-11 17.07.00" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-07-11-17.07.00-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you put the power cord, it directly starts up and everything already works fine. The state of each port is represented by a led. Orange indicates a 100Mbit/s connection while green indicates 1Gbit/s connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The switch does not make a single noise and does not vibrate, it is really good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Configuration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to configure the switch is to use the web configurator. By default, the switch IP is 192.168.1.1. As my router had the same IP, I had to disable it temporarily before changing the IP of the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web configuration is very complete, you can change absolutely everything from here. You have also access to a lot of monitoring tools from here. The most useful being of course the port monitoring interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screenshot-from-2013-07-11-172745.png"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2576" alt="Port Monitoring" src="http://baptiste-wicht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screenshot-from-2013-07-11-172745-300x132.png" width="300" height="132"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend changing the default IP address and the server password as first things on the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't make the list of everything that is configurable on this switch, but the list is pretty impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm really impressed by this switch. The switch is highly configurable and seems to perfectly fit my need. I would totally recommend this switch for rack installation at home. You can also totally use it as a desktop switch if you needs for a big switch on your desktop too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Hardware</category><category>Home Server</category><category>Network</category><category>Review</category><category>Server</category><guid>http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2013/07/zyxel-gs1910-managed-gigabit-switch-review.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2013 06:38:17 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
