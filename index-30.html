             Posted: <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2017-03-11T09:54:00+01:00">2017-03-11 09:54</time></small>

<div class="p-summary">
        <div>
<p>clang-tidy is an extensive linter C++. It provides a complete framework for
analysis of C++ code. Some of the checks are very simple but some of them are
very complete and most of the checks from the clang-static-analyzer are
integrated into clang-tidy.</p>
<div class="section" id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>If you want to see the list of checks available on clang-tidy, you can use the
list-checks options:</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_761b76656c4f4859b4e472644c366c88-1"></a>clang-tidy -list-checks
</pre>
<p>You can then choose the tests you are interested in and perform an analysis of
your code. For, it is highly recommended to use a Clang compilation database,
you can have a look at Bear to generate this compilation database if you don't
have it yet. The usage of clang-tidy, is pretty simple, you set the list of
checks you want, the header on which you want to have warnings reported and the
list of source files to analyse:</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_d325dc8ded614855ad6fa41e2635a5fc-1"></a>clang-tidy -checks='*' -header-filter="^include" -p . src/*.cpp
</pre>
<p>You'll very likely see a lot of warnings. And you will very likely see a lot of
false positives and a lot of warnings you don't agree too. For insance, there
are a lot of warnings from the CPP Core Guidelines and the Google Guidelines
that I don't follow in my coding. You should not take the complete list of tests
as rule, you should devise your own list of what you really want to fix in your
code. If you want to disable one check X, you can use the - operation:</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_497b9a7c62b04acfba8f0f6687cb1630-1"></a>clang-tidy -checks='*,-X' -header-filter="^include" -p . src/*.cpp
</pre>
<p>You can also enable the checks one by one or parts of them with *:</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_b5e6a1f5265547b7b57f628d95b27910-1"></a>clang-tidy -checks='google-*' -header-filter="^include" -p . src/*.cpp
</pre>
<p>One problem with the clang-tidy tool is that it is utterly slow, especially if
you enable the clang-static-analyzer checks. Moreover, if you use it like it is
set before, it will only use one thread for the complete set of files. This may
not be an issue on small projects, but this will definitely be a big issue for
large projects and template-heavy code (like my ETL project). You could create
an implicit target into your Makefile to use it on each file independently and
then use the -j option of make to make them in parallel, but it not really
practical.</p>
<p>For this, I just discovered that clang propose a Python script,
run-clang-tidy.py that does it all for us! On Gentoo, it is installed at
/usr/share/run-clang-tidy.py.</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_1548b67416484a9285a69ba3a4e895d3-1"></a>run-clang-tidy.py -checks='*' -header-filter="^include" -p . -j9
</pre>
<p>This will automatically run clang-tidy on each file from the compilation
database and use 9 threads to perform the checks. This is definitely much
faster. For me, this is the best way to run clang-tidy.</p>
<p>One small point I don't like is that the script always print the list of enabled
checks. For, this I changed this line in the script:</p>
<pre class="code python"><a name="rest_code_9bb440cf687f4277ac5ea1a52004a6c5-1"></a><span class="n">invocation</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">clang_tidy_binary</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'-list-checks'</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre>
<p>with:</p>
<pre class="code python"><a name="rest_code_58162589f8114e58a56e7f8aaaed212d-1"></a><span class="n">invocation</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">clang_tidy_binary</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre>
<p>This makes it more quiet.</p>
<p>One thing I didn't mention is that clang-tidy is able to fix some of the errors
directly if you use the -fix option. Personally, I don't like this, but for
a large code base and a carefully selected set of checks, this could be really
useful. Note that not all the checks are automatically fixable by clang-tidy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="results-2">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I have run clang-tidy on my cpp-utils library and here some interesting results.
I have not run all the checks, here is the command I used:</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_79b6ff9b0ca74aa2a0b33a392bf5c786-1"></a>/usr/share/clang/run-clang-tidy.py -p . -header-filter '^include/cpp_utils' -checks='cert-*,cppcoreguidelines-*,google-*,llvm-*,misc-*,modernize-*,performance-*,readility-*,-cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-reinterpret-cast,-cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-pointer-arithmetic,-google-readability-namespace-comments,-llvm-namespace-comment,-llvm-include-order,-google-runtime-references' -j9 2&gt;/dev/null  | /usr/bin/zgrep -v "^clang-tidy"
</pre>
<p>Let's go over some warnings I got:</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_d70e5a12ad874e9b97fd6b8cb3fe033b-1"></a>include/cpp_utils/assert.hpp:91:103: warning: consider replacing 'long' with 'int64' [google-runtime-int]

</pre>
<p>I got this one several times. It is indeed more portable to use <code>int64</code> rather than <code>long</code>.</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_cbda075a6280474f8e8017c4b52c6e7d-1"></a>include/cpp_utils/aligned_allocator.hpp:53:9: warning: use 'using' instead of 'typedef' [modernize-use-using]

<p>This one is part of the modernize checks, indicating that one should use
<code>using</code> rather than a <code>typedef</code> and I completely agree.</p>

<p>Another one from the modernize checks that I really like. This is completely
true.</p>

    explicit -->
<p>I don't agree that every constructor with one argument should be explicit,
sometimes you want implicit conversion. Nevertheless, this particular case is
very interesting since it is variadic, it can have one template argument and as
thus it can be implicitly converted from anything, which is pretty bad I think.</p>

<p>On this one, I completely agree, C-style casts should be avoided and much
clearer C++ style casts should be preferred.</p>

<p>This is one of the checks I don't agree with. Even though it makes sense to
prefer exception that are nothrow copy constructible, they should be caught by
const reference anyway. Moreover, this is here an exception from the standard
library.</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_0ffa6715736f426d9650ff4e2515a69a-1"></a>/home/wichtounet/dev/cpp_utils_test/include/cpp_utils/aligned_allocator.hpp:141:40: warning: do not use const_cast [cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-const-cast]

</pre>
<p>In general, I agree that using const_cast should be avoided as much as possible.
But there are some cases where they make sense. In this particular case, I don't
modify the object itself but some memory before the object that is unrelated and
I initialize myself.</p>
<p>I also had a few false positives, but overall nothing too bad. I'm quite
satisfied with the quality of the results. I'll fix these warnings in the coming
week.</p>
<p>Integration in Sonarqube</p>
<p>The sonar-cxx plugin just integrated support for clang-tidy in main. You need
to build the version yourself, the 0.9.8-SNAPSHOT version. You then can use
something like this in your sonar-project.properties file:</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_8a343e7385a641b092a6b49e5ad74e14-1"></a>sonar.cxx.clangtidy.reportPath=clang-tidy-report
</pre>
<p>and sonar-cxx will parse the results and integrate the issues in your sonar
report.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<img alt="/images/sonar-cxx-clang-tidy.png" src="images/sonar-cxx-clang-tidy.png"><p>You can see two of the warnings from clang-tidy :)</p>
<p>For now, I haven't integrate this in my Continuous Integration system because
I'm still having issues with clang-tidy and the compilation database. Because
the compilation contains absolute paths to the file and to the current
directory, it cannot be shared directly between servers. I have to find a way to
fix that so that clang-tidy can use on the other computer. I'll probably wait
till the sonar-cxx 0.9.8 version is released before integrating all this in
Sonarqube, but this is a great news for this plugin :)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion-4">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>clang-tidy is C++ linter that can analyze your code and checks for hundreds of
problems in it. With it, I have found some very interesting problems in the code
of my cpp_utils library. Moreover, you can now integrate it Sonarqube by using
the sonar-cxx plugin. Since it is a bit slow, I'll probably not integrate it in
my bigger projects, but I'll integrate at least in the cpp_utils library when
sonar-cxx 0.9.8 will be released.</p>

<p>One week ago, zapcc 1.0 was released and I've observed it to be much faster than the other
compilers in terms of compile time. This can be seen when
<a class="reference external" href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/03/release-zapcc-10-fast-cpp-compiler.html">I tested it on my Expression Templates Library (ETL)</a>. It was almost four
times faster than clang 3.9 and about 2.5 times faster than GCC.</p>
<p>The ETL library is quite heavy to compile, but still reasonable. This is not the
case for my Deep Learning Library (DLL) where compiling all the test cases takes
a very long time. I have to admit that I have been going overboard with
templates and such and I have now to pay the price. In practice, for the users
of the library, this is not a big problem since only one or two neural networks
will be compiled (and it will take hours to train), but in the test cases, there
are hundreds of them and this is a huge pain. Anyway, enough with the ramble,
I figured it would be very good to test zapcc on it and see what I can gain from
using it.</p>
<p>In this article, when I speak of a compiler thread, I mean an instance of the
processor, so it's really a process in the Linux world.</p>
<div class="section" id="results">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>However, I soon realized that I would have more issues than I thought. The first
problem is the memory consumed by zapcc. Indeed, it is based on clang and
I always had problem with huge memory consumption from clang on this library and
zapcc has even bigger memory consumption because some information is cached
between runs. The amount of memory that zapcc is able to cache can be configured
in the configuration file. By default, it can use 1.5Go of memory. When zapcc
goes over the memory limit, it simply wipes out its caches. This means that all
the gain for the next compilation will be lost, since the cache will have to be
rebuilt from scratch. This is not a hard limit for the compilation itself.
Indeed, if the compilation itself takes 3Go, it will still be able to complete
it, but it is likely that the cache will be wiped after the compilation.</p>
<p>When I tried compiling using several threads, it soon used all my memory and
crashed. The same occurs with clang but I can still compile with 3 or 4 threads
without too much issues on this computer. The same also occurs with GCC but it
can still handle 4 or 5 threads (depending on the order of the compilation
units).</p>
<p>The tests are performed on my desktop computer at work, which is not really
good... I have 12Go of RAM (I had to ask for extra...) and an old Sandy Bridge
processor, but at least I have an SSD (also had to ask for extra).</p>
<p>I started with testing with only one compiler thread. For zapcc, I set the
maximum memory limit to 8Go. Even with such a limit, the zapcc server restarted
more than 10 times during the compilation of the 84 test cases. After this first
experiment, I increased the number of threads to 2 for each compiler, using 4Go
limit for zapcc. The limit is for each server and each parallel thread will
spawn a new server, so the effective limit is the number of threads times the
limit. Even with two threads, I was unable to finish a compilation with zapcc.
This is quite disappoint for me since clang is able to run with 4 threads in
parallel. Moreover, a big problem with that is that the servers are not always
killed when there is no no more memory, they just hang and use all the memory of
the computer, which is evidently really inconvenient for service processes. When
this happens with clang or gcc, the compiler simply crashes and the memory is
released and make is interrupted. Since zapcc is not able to work with more than
one thread on this computer, the results are the ones with one thread. I was
also surprised to be able to compile the library with clang and four threads,
this was not possible before clang-3.9.</p>

<p>If we look at the results with only one thread, we can see that there still are
some significant improvements when using zapcc, but nowhere near as good as what
was seen in the compilation of ETL. Here, the compilation time is reduced by 34%
compared to gcc and by 27% compared to clang. This is not bad, since it is
faster than the other compilers, but I would have expected better speedups. We
can see that g++-4.9 is slightly faster than g++-5.3, but this is not really
a significant difference. I'm actually very surprised to find that clang is
faster than g++ on this experiment. On ETL, it is always very significantly
slower and before, it was also significantly slower on DLL. I was so used to
this, that I stopped using it on this project. I may have to reconsider my
position when working on this project.</p>
<p>Let's look at the results with more than two threads. Even with two threads,
every compiler is faster than zapcc. Indeed, zapcc is slower than Clang by 25%
and slower than GCC by about 15%. If we use more threads, the other compilers
are becoming even faster and the slowdowns of zapcc are more important. When
using four threads, zapcc is about 48% slower than gcc and about 50% slower than
clang. This is really showing one big downside of zapcc that has a very large
memory consumption. When it is used to compile really heavy template code, it is
failing very early to use more processes. And even when there is enough memory,
the speedups are not as great as for relatively simpler code.</p>
<p>One may argue that this is not a fair comparison since zapcc does not have the
same numbers of threads. However, considering that this is the best zapcc can do
on this machine, I would argue that this is a fair comparison in this limited
experimental setting. If we were to have a big machine for compilation, which
I don't have at work, the zapcc results would likely be more interesting, but in
this specific limited case, it shows that zapcc suffers from its high memory
consumption. It should also be taken into account that this experiment was done
with almost nothing else running on the machine (no browser for instance) to
have as much memory as possible available for the compilers. This is not
a common use case.  Most of the days, when I compile something, I have my
browser open, which makes a large difference in memory available, and several
other applications (but consoles and vim instances do not really consume memory
:D).</p>
<p>This experiment made me realize that the compilation times for this library were
quickly becoming crazy. Most of the time, the complete test suite is only
compiled on my Continuous Integration machine at home which has a much faster
processor and much more RAM. Therefore, it is relatively fast since it uses more
threads to compile.  Nevertheless, this is not a good point that the unit tests
takes so much time to compile. I plan to split the test cases in several sets.
Because, currently the real unit tests are compiled with the performance tests
and other various tests. I'll probably end up generating three executables. This
will help greatly during development. Moreover, I also have a technique to
decrease the compilation time by erasing some template parameters at compilation
time. This is already ready, but has currently a runtime overhead that I will
try to remove and then use this technique everywhere to get back to reasonable
compilation times. I'll also try to see if I can find obvious compilation
bottlenecks in the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion-3">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude, while zapcc brings some very interesting compilation speedups in
some cases like in my ETL library, it also has some downsides, namely
<strong>huge memory consumption</strong>. This memory consumption may prevent the use of several
compiler threads and render zapcc much less interesting than other compilers.</p>
<p>When trying to compile my DLL library on a machine with 12Go of RAM with two
zapcc threads, it was impossible for me to make it complete. While zapcc was
faster with one thread than the other compilers, they were able to use up to
four threads and in the end <strong>zapcc was about twice slower than clang</strong>.</p>
<p>I knew that zapcc memory consumption was very large, but I would have not have
expected something so critical. Another feature that would be interesting in
zapcc would be to set a max memory hard limit for the server instead of simply
a limit on the cache they are able to keep in memory. This would prevent hanging
the complete computer when something goes wrong.</p>
<p>I had a good surprise with clang that was actually faster than GCC and also able
to work with four threads in parallel. This was not the case with previous
version of clang. On ETL, it is still significantly slower than GCC though.</p>
<p>For now, I'll continue using clang on this DLL project and use zapcc only on my
ETL project. I'll also focus on improving the compilation time on this project
and make it reasonable again.</p>

<p>For several years now I've been using Owncloud running on one of my servers.
I'm using simply using as a simple synchronization, I don't use any of the tons
of fancy features they keep adding. Except from several synchronization issues,
I haven't had too much issues with it.</p>
<p>However, I have had a very bad time with updates of Owncloud. The last time
I tried, already long ago, was to upgrade from 5.0 to 6.0 and I never succeeded
without losing all the configuration and having to do the resync. Therefore,
I've still an Owncloud 5.0 running. From this time, I had to say that I've been
lazy and didn't try again to upgrade it. Recently, I've received several mails
indicating that this is a security threat.</p>
<p>Since I was not satisfied with updates in Owncloud and its security has been
challenged recently, I figured it would be a good moment to upgrade to Nextcloud
which is a very active fork of Owncloud that was forked by developers of
Owncloud.</p>
<p>I haven't even tried to do an upgrade from such an old version to the last
version of Nextcloud, it was doomed to fail. Therefore, I made a new clean
installation. Since I only use the sync feature of the tool, it does not really
matter, it is just some time lost to sync everything again, but nothing too bad.</p>
<p>I configured a new PostgreSQL on one of my servers for the new database and then
installed Nextcloud 11 on Gentoo. It's a bit a pain to have a working Nginx
configuration for Nextcloud, I don't advice to do it by hand, better take one
from the official documentation, you'll also gain some security. One very bad
thing in the installation process is that you cannot choose the database prefix,
it's set like Owncloud. The problem with that is that you cannot install both
Owncloud and Nextcloud on the same database which would be more practical for
testing purpose. It's a bit retarded in my opinion, but not a big problem in the
end. Other than these two points, everything went well and it was installation
pretty nicely. Then, you should have your user ready to go.</p>
<img alt="Nextcloud view" class="align-center" src="images/nextcloud.png"><p>As for the interface, I don't think there is a lot to tell here. Most of it is
what you would except from this kind of tool. Moreover, I very rarely use the
web interface or any of the feature that are not the sync feature. One thing
that is pretty cool I think is the monitoring graphs in the Admin section of the
interface. You can the number of users connected, the memory used and the CPU
load. It's pretty useful if you share your Nextcloud between a lot of different
users.</p>
<p>I didn't have any issue with the sync either. I used the nextcloud-client
package on Gentoo directly and it worked perfectly directly. It took about 10
minutes to sync everything again (about 5GB). I'll have to do the same thing on
my other computer as well, but I don't think I'll have any issue.</p>
<p>So far, I cannot say that this is better than Owncloud, I just hope the next
upgrade will fare better than they did on Owncloud. Moreover, I also hope that
the security that they promise is really here and I won't have any problem with
it. I'll see in the future!</p>

        <div>
<p>If you remember, I recently wrote about <a class="reference external" href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2016/12/zapcc-cpp-compilation-speed-against-gcc-54-and-clang-39.html">zapcc C++ compilation speed against gcc 5.4 and clang 3.9</a> in which I was comparing the beta version of zapcc against gcc and clang.</p>
<p>I just been informed that zapcc was just released in version 1.0. I though it
was a good occasion to test it again. It will be compared against gcc-4.9,
gcc-5.3 and clang-3.9. This version is based on the trunk of clang-5.0.</p>
<p>Again, I will use my Expression Template Library (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/etl/">ETL</a>) project. This is a purely header-only
library with lots of templates. I'm going to compile the full test cases. This
is a perfect example for long compilation times.</p>
<p>The current tests are made on the last version of the library and with slightly
different parameters for compilation, therefore the absolute times are not
comparable, but the speedups should be comparable.</p>
<p>Just like last time, I have configured zapcc to let is use 2Go RAM per caching
server, which is the maximum allowed. Moreover, I killed the servers before each
tests.</p>
<div class="section" id="debug-results">
<h2>Debug results</h2>
<p>Let's start with a debug build, with no optimizations enabled. Every build will
use four threads. This is the equivalent of doing make -j4 debug/bin/etl_test
without the link step.</p>

<p>The speedups are even more impressive than last time! zapcc is <strong>almost four
times fast than clang-3.9</strong> and around <strong>2.5 times faster than GCC-5.3</strong>.
Interestingly, we can see that gcc-5.3 is slighly slower than GCC-4.9.</p>
<p>It seems that they have the compiler even faster!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="release-results">
<h2>Release results</h2>
<p>Let's look now how the results are looking with optimizations enabled. Again,
every build will use four threads. This is the equivalent of doing make -j4
release_debug/bin/etl_test without the link step.</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">

<td>1.06</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can see that this time the speedups are not as interesting as they were.
Very interestingly, it's the compiler that suffers the more from the
optimization overhead. Indeed, zapcc is three times slower in release mode than
it was in debug mode. Nevertheless, it still manages to beat the three other
compilers, by about 10% for Gcc and 50% than clang, which is already
interesting.</p>
<div class="section" id="conclusion-2">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>To conclude, we have observed that zapcc is always faster than the three
compilers tested in this experiment. Moreover, in debug mode, the speedups are
very significant, it was almost 4 times faster than clang and around 2.5 faster
than gcc.</p>
<p>I haven't seen any problem with the tool, it's like clang and it should generate
code of the same performance, but just compile it much faster. One problem
I have with zapcc is that it is not based on an already released version of
clang but on the trunk. That means it is hard to be compare with the exact same
version of clang and it is also a risk of running into clang bugs.</p>
<p>Although the prices have not been published yet, it is indicated on the website
that zapcc is free for non-commercial entities. Which is really great.</p>

<div class="p-summary">
        <div>
<p>I have several devices in my home that can be controller via Domoticz, a few
power outlets, a few lights (more are coming), my Kodi home theater. And I have
a lot of sensors and information gathered by Domoticz. All of this is working
quite well, but I have only a few actuators and intelligence (motion sensor,
button and some automation via Lua script).</p>
<p>My next objective was to add voice control to my system. If I was living in
United States or United Kingdom I would directly an Amazon Dot or even an Amazon
Echo, but they are not available in Switzerland. I could have arranged for
delivery, but if I want my system to be useful to several people, I need to have
in French. It's the same problem with the Google Home system. So, no other way
than custom solutions.</p>
<p>Since I had an extra Raspberry Pi 2, I based my system on this. I bought a Trust
Mico microphone and a Trust Compact speakers and installed them on the Pi. Both
peripherals are working quite well.</p>
<p>You can have a closer look at my microphone:</p>
<img alt="Trust Mico microphone for Jarvis Home Automation Voice Control" class="align-center" src="images/jarvis_mic.jpg"><p>and the complete installation:</p>
<img alt="Jarvis Home Automation Voice Control around my TV" class="align-center" src="images/jarvis_full.jpg"><p>The Raspberry Pi is on the bottom, the speakers below the TV, left and right and
the microphone on the top right.</p>
<p>For the voice control software, I decided to go with Jarvis. It seems to me that
this is the best suited software for this kind of project. Moreover, it supports
French natively which seems good. I also tried Jasper, but this has been such
a pain to install that I gave up.</p>
<p>Jarvis is reasonably easy to install if you have a recent Raspbian image. It
took some time to install the dependencies, but in the end it was not difficult.
The installation process has a step-by-step wizard help so it's really easy to
configure everything.</p>
<p>However, even if it's easy to install, it's easy to configure correctly. The
first thing is to configure the hotword to activate commands. There are several
options, but I used snowboy which is offline and is made for hotword
recognition. This worked quite well, you just have to train a model with the
hotword to recognize the voice. After this, the problems started... You then
have to configure audio for the commands themselves. There are 6 parameters for
audio capture (noise levels to start and stop the capture, silence levels, ...)
and no help to tune them. So basically, I tried a lot of combinations until
I had something working reasonably well. When you are in debug mode, you can
listen to what the system captured. These parameters are dependent on your
environment and on your microphone and on your voice. I may be dumb but it took
several hours and a lot of tries to get a configuration working. After this, you
have to choose the engine for recognition of the commands. Unfortunately, all
the good options are online so everything you'll say as commands after the
hotword will be sent online. I first tried Bing, but I had very poor recognition
rate. I then switched to wit.ai which gave me better results. In the end, I have
about 60% recognition rate, which is not great at all, but at least some phrases
are working almost all the time while others are always failing. Another problem
I have with this is the large delay between commands and action. It takes almost
five seconds between the end of my sentence and the time where the lights in my
living room are tuned on or off by Jarvis via Domoticz.</p>
<p>So far, I'm a bit disappointed by the quality of the system, but maybe I was
hoping for too much. I have been able to control a few of my appliances but not
really reliably. Another thing I have realized is that when counting the
Raspberry Pi, its enclosure the Microphone and the speakers, this system is more
costly than an Amazon Dot and seem highly inferior (and is much less good
looking).</p>
<p>I'll try to improve the current system with better configuration and commands in
the coming days and I will maybe try another system for voice control. I still
hope Amazon Alexa systems or Google Home are made available in
France/Switzerland not too far in the future, since I believe these systems are
a better solution than custom made systems, at least for now. Moreover, next
month, I plan to integrate ZWave into my systems with a few sensors, complete
the lighting installation and add new motion sensors. This should make it more
useful. And hopefully, by this time, I should have a good voice control system,
but I'm not too hopeful.</p>
<p>Don't hesitate to comment or contact me if you have questions about this
installation or want to share experience about voice control in home automation.
If you want more details about this, dont' hesitate to ask as well ;)</p>

<p>Recently, we have published a paper about performance optimizations that may
interest you.</p>
<p>The paper is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307908790_On_CPU_Performance_Optimization_of_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine_and_Convolutional_RBM">On CPU Performance Optimizations for Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Convolutional RBM</a>, published in the Proceedings of the Artificial Neural Networks and Pattern Recognition workshop (ANNPR-2016). I've presented this paper in Germany, at Ulm.</p>
<p>Although most of the performance research going on is focused on GPU, there are
still of research laboratories that are only equipped with CPU and it remains
important to be as fast as possible on CPU. Moreover, this is something
I really like.</p>
<p>For this publication, I have tried to make my Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
and Convolutional RBM (CRBM) implementations in my DLL library as fast as
possible.</p>
<p>The first part of the article is about Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) which
are a form of dense Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Their training is very
similar to that of the ANN with Gradient Descent. Four different network
configurations are being tested.</p>
<p>First, mini-batch training is shown to be much faster than online training, even
when online training is performed in parallel. Once mini-batch training is used,
BLAS operations are used in order to get as much performance as possible on the
different operations, mainly the Matrix Matrix Multiplication with the use of
the GEMM operation from the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL). Moreover, the
parallel version of the MKL is also used to get even more performance. When all
these optimizations are performed, speedups of 11 to 30 are obtained compared to
the online training, depending on the network configurations. This final version
is able  to perform one epoch of Contrastive Divergence in 4 to 15 seconds
depending on the network, for 60000 images.</p>
<p>The second part of the article is about Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann
Machine (CRBM). This is almost the equivalent of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). Again four different networks are evaluated.</p>
<p>The main problem with CRBM is that there are no standard implementations of the
convolution operation that is really fast. Therefore, it is not possible to
simply use a BLAS library to make the computation as fast as possible. The first
optimization that was tried is to vectorize the convolutions. With this, the
speedups have been between 1.1 and 1.9 times faster. I'm not really satisfied
with these results since in fact per convolution the speedups are much better.
Moreover, I have since been able to obtain better speedups but the deadline was
too short to include them in this paper. I'll try to talk about these
improvements in more details on this blog. What is more interesting to to
parallellize the different convolutions since they are mostly independent. This
can bring a speedup of the amount of cores available on the machine. Since
convolutions are extremely memory hungry, virtual cores with Hyper Threading
generally does not help. An interesting optimization is to use a Matrix
Multiplication to compute several valid convolutions at once.  This can give an
additional speedup between 1.6 and 2.2 compared to the vectorized version. While
it is possible to use the FFT to reduce the full convolution as well, in our
experiment the images were not big enough for this to be interesting. The final
speedups are about 10 times faster with these optimizations.</p>
<p>We have obtained pretty good and I'm happy we have been published. However, I'm
not very satisfied with these results since I've been able to get even faster
since this and when compared with other frameworks, DLL is actually quite
competitive. I'll try to publish something new in the future.</p>

<p>I recently realized that I never talked about my publications on this website...
I thought it was time to start. I'll start to write a few posts about my earlier
publications and then I'll try to write something for the new ones not too late.</p>
<p>For the story, I'm currently a PHD student at the University of Fribourg, in
Switzerland. My PHD is about the use of Deep Learning technologies to
automatically extract features from images. I have developed my Deep Learning
Library (DLL) project for this thesis. We have published a few articles on the
various projects that we tackled during the thesis. I'll try to go in order.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the thesis, I used Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Deep
Belief Network to perform digit recognition on images of Sudoku taken with
a phone camera. We published two papers on this subject.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282303748_Camera-based_Sudoku_recognition_with_deep_belief_network">Camera-based Sudoku Recognition with Deep Belief Network</a>, in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition (SOCPAR-2014)</li>
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307545305_Mixed_handwritten_and_printed_digit_recognition_in_Sudoku_with_Convolutional_Deep_Belief_Network">Mixed Handwritten and printed digit recognition in Sudoku With Convolutional Deep Belief Network</a>, in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR-2015)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sudoku grid and digits are detected using standard image processing
techniques:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The image is first converted to grayscale, then a median blur is applied to
remove noise and the image is binarized using Adapteive Thresholding</li>
<li>The edges are detected using the Canny algorithm. From these, the lines are
detected using a Progressive Probabilistic Hough Transform</li>
<li>Using a connected component analysis, the segments of lines are clustered
together to detect the Sudoku Grid</li>
<li>The cells are then detected inside the grid using the inner lines and contour
detection is used to isolate the digits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is one of the original images from our dataset:</p>
<img alt="Original image from our dataset" class="align-center" src="images/image124.jpg"><p>Here are the detected characters from the previous image:</p>
<img alt="Detected digits from our application" class="align-center" src="images/image124_char.jpg"><p>Once all the digits have been found they are passed to a Deep Belief Network for
recognition. A Deep Belief Network is composed of several Restricted Boltzmann
Machines (RBM) that are stacked. The network is pretrained, by training each
RBM, in turn, with Contrastive Divergence. This algorithm basically trains each
RBM as an auto-encoder and learns a good feature representation of the inputs.
Once all the layers have been trained, the network can then be trained as
a regular neural network with Stochastic Gradient Descent.</p>
<p>In the second paper, the images of Sudoku are containing both computer printed
and handwritten digits (the grid is already filled). The other difference is
that the second system used a Convolutional DBN instead of DBN. The difference
being that each layer is a Convolutional RBM. Such a model will learn a set of
small filters that will be applied to each position of the image.</p>
<p>On the second version of the dataset, we have been able to achieve 99.14% of
recognition of the digits or 92.5% of fully-recognized grid  with the
Convolutional Network.</p>
<p>You can find the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wichtounet/sudoku_recognizer">C++ implementation on Github</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to have a look, I've updated the
<a class="reference external" href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/stories/publications.html">list of my publications</a>
on this website.</p>
<p>If you want more details on this project, don't hesitate to ask here or on
Github, or read the paper :)
The next post about my publications will probably be about CPU performances!</p>

        <div>
<p>Recently, <a class="reference external" href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2017/01/new-home-automation-system-with-domoticz.html#">I switched from my hand crafted home automation system to Domoticz</a>.
This allows me to easily integrate new smart devices and remote controllable
peripherals without much effort. I plan to relate my effort in having fun
controlling my home :)</p>
<p>I'm now able to control lights in two rooms with Domoticz. The most well-known
smart bulbs are the Philips Hue. However, they are stupidly expensive. There are
a lot of alternatives. I've ordered some Milight light bulbs and controller to
test with Domoticz. I didn't order a lot of them because I wanted to make sure
they would work with my system.
Milight system is working over Wifi. There are several components to a Milight
system:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The LED Light Bulbs with Red/Green/Blue/White channels</li>
<li>The Wifi Controller that is able to control 4 zones</li>
<li>An RGBW Controller for LED strip</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two are necessary for any installation, the third is to control an
RGBW LED strip. This list is not exhaustive, it's only the components that
I have used. It is important to note that a single Wifi controller can only
control 4 zones. There are also remotes, but I have not bought one since I plan
to use them only from Domoticz and maybe smartphone.</p>
<p>The installation of the controller is relatively easy. You need to download the
Milight 2.0 application on the Android Play Store (or the equivalent for IOS).
Then, you can power on the Wifi Controller. It'll create a new Wifi on which you
can then connect on your phone. Then, you can use the application on your phone
to configure the device and make it connect to your home wireless network. Once,
this is done, you can connect your phone back to your home network. You can then
use the Milight application to configure your device. I highly recommend to set
a static IP address to the controller. The way I did it is simply to set a fixed
IP address on my DHCP server based on the MAC address of the MAC controller but
you can simply do the configuration in the application or in the web interface
of the controller (the user and password combination is admin:admin).</p>
<p>Here is the look of the controller (next to my RFLink):</p>
<img alt="Milight wifi controller" class="align-center" src="images/system.jpg"><p>(My phone is starting to die, hence the very bad quality of images)</p>
<p>You can then install your LED light bulbs. For, open first the remote on your
Android Milight application. Then plug the light bulb without power first. Then
power on the light and press once on one of the I buttons on one of the zones on
the remote. This will link the LED to the selected zone on the controller. You
can then control the light from your phone. Remember, only four zones and
therefore four lights per controller.</p>
<p>The installation for a LED strip is not much complicated. You need to plug the
4 wires (or 5 wires if your have an actual RGBW LED) into the corresponding
inputs on the controller. Then, you power it and you can link it to a zone like
a normal light bulb!</p>
<img alt="LEDS in my Living Room controlled by Milight" class="align-center" src="images/leds.jpg"><p>It works really well and directly without problems.</p>
<p>The last step is of course to configure your controller in Domoticz. It is
really easy to do. You need to add a new hardware of each of the Milight
controller. It is listed under the name "Limitless/AppLamp/Mi Light with
LAN/WiFi interface". You then can set the IP address and the port by default is
8899. Once you did configure the hardware, you'll see new devices appear in the
Devices list. There will one device for each zone and one device to control all
four zones at once. You can add the device you already configured as switches.
From the Switches interface you can turn the lamp on and off and you can</p>
<img alt="Domoticz Light Bulbs control" class="align-center" src="images/domoticz_rgbw.png"><p>You can then put them on your floor plan or control them from your rules.</p>
<p>So far, I'm pretty satisfied with this Milight system. The Android application
is of poor quality but aside from this is pretty good and the price is very
fair. I'm also really satisfied with the Domoticz support. The only that is sad
is that the Domoticz Android application does not support RGBW control of the
lamps, only on and off, but that is already cool.</p>
<p>Now that all of this is working well, I've ordered a few more light bulbs to
cover all my rooms and a few LED controller to control (and install first) the
other LEDS that I have in mind.</p>
<p>On another note, I've also added a new outside temperature sensor outside my
apartment. It is a very cheap Chinese sensor, bought on Ebay, based on the
XT200 system that is working very well with RFLink.</p>
<p>The next step in my system is probably to integrate Voice Control, but I don't
know exactly which way I'll go. I ordered a simple microphone that I intend to
plug on my spare Raspberry Pi, but I don't know if the range will be enough to
cover a room. Ideally, I would like to use an Amazon Dot, but they are not
available in Switzerland. I'll probably write more on the subject once I've
found an adequate solution. Another idea I've is to integrate support for ZWave
via OpenZWave and then add a few more cool sensors that I haven't found on an
cheaper system.</p>
<p>I hope this is interesting and don't hesitate if you have any question about my
home automation project. You can expect a few more posts about this as soon as
In improve it :)</p>

        <div>
<p>I've been using the Pentadactyl Firefox extension for a long time. This
extensions "vimifies" Firefox and it does a very good job of it. This is
probably the best extension I have ever seen on any browser. This post is really
not against Pentadactyl, this is a great addon and it still works great.</p>
<p>However, I have been more and more dissatisfied of Mozilla Firefox over the
years. Indeed, the browser is becoming slower and slower all the time and I'm
experiencing more and more issues on Gentoo with it. But the biggest problem
I've with Firefox right now is the philosophy of the developers that is really
crappy. Currently, there is only one thing that is good in Firefox compared to
the other browsers, its extensions. Basically, an extension in Firefox can do
almost anything. Pentadactyl is able to transform most of the interface and get
rid of all of the useless parts of the interface. It is currently impossible to
do so in other browsers. These powerful addons are using the XUL/XPCOM
programming interface to do so. Pentadactyl is the only reason I've kept to
Firefox so long. But Firefox has announced, already more than a year ago, that
it will deprecate its XUL/XPCOM interface in favour of webextensions. This means
that a lot of very good addons will not be able to work anymore once the
deprecation has been completed. Several writers of popular Firefox have
announced that they will not even try to port their addons and some addons will
simply not be possible anymore. This is the case for Pentadactyl which is on the
line for when the deprecation occurs. The data for deprecated has already been
delayed but is likely to come anyway.</p>
<p>For several months, I've been looking at several possible replacements for my
current Pentadactyl browser. I've tried qutebrowser, but it is really too
limited in terms of features so far. I've also tried again Chromium which is
a great browser but unfortunately, there are very few possibilities for addons
to modify the interface. Vimium is a great addon for Chromium which is basically
the very much more lightweight alternative to Pentadactyl. It has much less
features, but most of the missing features are simply things that cannot be done
in Chromium.</p>
<p>Only recently did I test Vivaldi. Vivaldi is a free multi-platform browser,
based on Chromium and supporting Chromium extensions. The major difference with
Chrome is how the UI is customizable, due to the use of a dynamic UI, stylable
with CSS. With the customizability of Vivaldi plus the great shortcuts and
vim-like behaviour of vimium, I really feel like I found a new Pentadactyl with
the advantage of not having to bear Firefox!</p>
<p>Here is how it is looking with the follow URLs feature from vimium:</p>
<img alt="View of my Vivaldi browser" class="align-center" src="images/vivaldi.png"><p>Note: The gray bar on the left is the console to the left and the top kind of
bar is awesome wm, they are not part of the browser.</p>
<p>I'm using the dark theme with native windows. I've disabled the address bar,
moved the tab bar to the bottom and completely hidden the side panel. All that
remained was the title bar and the scroll bar.</p>
<p>To get rid of the title bar, you can use CSS. First, you have to only display
the Vivaldi button in the settings page. Then, you can use this custom CSS:</p>
<pre class="code CSS"><a name="rest_code_52e2b6706a8240df886df4a58fa9c14d-1"></a><span class="nt">button</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">vivaldi</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</pre>
<p>to hide the title completely! To get rid of the scroll bar, you need to use the
Stylish extension and use this custom CSS:</p>
<pre class="code CSS"><a name="rest_code_4e54899e749b424d9deed4922bf4986f-1"></a><span class="p">::</span><span class="nd">-webkit-scrollbar</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="k">display</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="kc">none</span> <span class="cp">!important</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">width</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="kt">px</span><span class="p">;}</span>
<a name="rest_code_4e54899e749b424d9deed4922bf4986f-2"></a><span class="p">::</span><span class="nd">-webkit-scrollbar-button</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nd">-webkit-scrollbar-track</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="k">display</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="kc">none</span> <span class="cp">!important</span><span class="p">;}</span>
<a name="rest_code_4e54899e749b424d9deed4922bf4986f-3"></a><span class="p">::</span><span class="nd">-webkit-scrollbar-thumb</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="k">display</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">none</span> <span class="cp">!important</span><span class="p">;}</span>
<a name="rest_code_4e54899e749b424d9deed4922bf4986f-4"></a><span class="p">::</span><span class="nd">-webkit-scrollbar-track</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="k">display</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">none</span> <span class="cp">!important</span><span class="p">;}</span>
</pre>
<p>And then, no more scroll bar :)</p>
<p>If you want to have full HTML5 video support, you need to install extra codecs.
On Gentoo, I've uploaded a ebuild on my overlay (wichtounet on layman) with the
name vivaldi-ffmpeg-codecs and everything should be working fine :)</p>
<p>Vimium is clearly inferior to Pentadactyl in that for instance it only works in
web page, not in system page and you still have to use the browser for a few
things, but it does not seem too bar so far. Moreover, I wasn't using all the
features of Pentadactyl. I haven't been used this browser for a long time, so
maybe there are things that I will miss from Pentadactyl, but I won't certainly
miss Firefox!</p>

        <hr>
<div class="p-summary">
        <div>
<p>As you may remember, I started going into Home Automation last year with a <a class="reference external" href="http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2016/08/asgard-home-automation-project.html">C++ project, Asgard</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I haven't add the time to improve this project further and make
it really useful and I have so many C++ projects already, so I decided to switch
to using an existing project.</p>
<div class="section" id="choice">
<h2>Choice</h2>
<p>I needed a system that was at least able to handle everything my existing system
does:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Control my RF-433 Temperature Sensors (Oregon Temperature Sensors)</li>
<li>Control my RF-433 Remote Button</li>
<li>Control my smart power outlets</li>
<li>Ping and wake-on-lan my different computers</li>
<li>Be installable on a Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>Control Skadi/Kodi Home Cinema</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, it also had to be open source and in a language that I can write
without agonizing pain (no Ruby, no JavaScript, ideally no Python (I hate a lot
of languages...)).</p>
<p>It's impressive the number of home automation projects that exist today. It's
really a hot topic, more than I though. After a few hours of research, I've
finally settled on Domoticz. It seemed that it could handle all my home
automation devices that I already had. Domoticz is an open source home
automation system. It's written mainly in C++, which is an advantage for me
since I'll be able to work inside it if necessary. It has a quite modern HTML5
interface. It has a lot of support for hardware and a lot of bridges for other
controllers as well. One of the reason I chose it is also the floor-planner
feature that looks really cool.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installation">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>First of all, I cleaned the hardware of my Raspberry Pi. I got rid of my
breadboard and the components on it. Then, I put the Raspberry Pi on a nicer box
that I had laying around. One problem with Domoticz is that it does not support
directly RF433 devices, but need a controller in the middle. At first,
I believed I could simply connect them through GPIO and lets Domoticz do the
rest, but it's not possible. I ordered the different pieces for a RFLink
controller at nodo-shops. It is running on a Arduino Mega and is connected to
the Pi. The very big advantage is that they handle a lot of protocols directly,
so you only have to read the serial port to get information on RF-433 events.</p>
<p>Here is how the current system look:</p>
<img alt="Asgard automation system hardware" class="align-center" src="images/home_automation_hardware.jpg"><p>The black box is the Arduino Mega with RFLink software while the Transparent is
simply the Raspberry on which Domoticz is installed.</p>
<p>As for the installation of Domoticz, it's really simple. They also have images of
Raspberry Pi directly, but since my Raspberry was already installed with
Raspbian, I installed Domoticz on it directly. A simple matter of curl and bash:</p>
<pre class="code bash"><a name="rest_code_6d75cde765f84de2bdc30c866ff4899e-1"></a>sudo curl -L install.domoticz.com <span class="p">|</span> sudo bash
</pre>
<p>After a few questions, your installation should be complete. You can browse your

<h2>Home Automation with Domoticz</h2>
<p>There are several concepts in Domoticz that are important. At first, it seemed
a bit weird to me, but in the end it works really well and you get used to it
pretty fast.</p>
<p>The first concept is the hardware. It is not necessary hardware directly, but
rather a driver to some piece of information of switches than a real hardware in
my opinion. For instance, the RFLink Gateway is considered hardware as well as
the Forecast weather API. Here is all the hardware I've configured:</p>
<img alt="Domoticz Hardware Configuration" class="align-center" src="images/domoticz_hardware.png"><p>I've got some sensors from the motherboard, the Kodi interaction, the driver to
ping the different computers, the Forecast weather with Dark Sky and Weather
Underground, the RFLink communication, the wake-on-lan and some dummies virtual
switches.</p>
<p>On its own, an hardware is useless, but it can create devices that will be used
for home automation. A device is sub device of a particular driver. In some
cases, the devices will be created automatically. For instance, RF Link can
create devices as soon as they are detected. For wake-on-lan, you have to
configure MAC Addresses and they will be added as devices. And so on...</p>
<p>There are a lot of types of devices, also called switches. Some devices can do
some actions, for instance the wake-on-lan devices, while others are information
based such as ping or temperature sensors detected from the RFLink. For
instance, here are my temperature sensors:</p>
<img alt="Domoticz Temperature Sensors" class="align-center" src="images/domoticz_temperature.png"><p>As for my hardware I already had, I haven't add too many issues with them. The
Oregon Temperature Sensors worked out of the box without any issues as well my
old RF433 Ninja Block temperature sensor. The smart power outlets have been
pretty easy to use as well. The most problem I've add was with the remote
buttons. It seems to many that it should be the easiest, but RFLink has a lot of
problem with them, they are detected several times and are highly unreliable.
Interestingly you can also change the icon of most device to a large variety of
existing devices so that they would look more realistic.</p>
<p>Another feature I find pretty cool is the floor plan. You can create plans for
each floor of your house and then create rooms inside and finally attach devices
to each room and place inside the plan. Unfortunately, to draw the plan, you'll
have to use an external tool. I've used floorplanner for this, but you may use
any plan you have as long as you have an image.</p>
<p>Here is my floor plan with the devices (the scale is terribly off :P) :</p>
<img alt="Domoticz Floor Plan" class="align-center" src="images/domoticz_floorplan.png"><p>With that you can directly see the status of each of your sensors in each room.
Moreover, you can also activate some devices directly from the floor plan as
well :)</p>
<p>Normally, my Somfy blinds are supposed to work with the RFLink controller.
I have managed to control my blinds but only when the RFLink was within 50
centimeters of the Blinds, which is clearly not acceptable. I don't know from
where the problem comes. It may come from my Blinds controller inside the wall
or may come from bad antenna of the RFLink or from a bug in RFLink, so from now
I cannot control my blinds.</p>
<p>I have several D-Link cameras at home. You can also add cameras to Domoticz, but
don't expect a lot of support on this side. It's pretty poor indeed. The only
useful you can do in Domoticz with Cameras is to take a screenshot from them.
You cannot control the Camera or even have a decent video stream and cannot do
motion detection directly. I hope that the Camera support will improve in the
future. One thing that would be good is to add a view of the cameras in the
floor plan, but it is not possible currently.</p>
<p>What I did is to use Zoneminder to manage the cameras and send alert to Domoticz
when motion is detect with the REST API of Domoticz. Unfortunately that means
two systems to manage the Cameras. Zoneminder is a very good piece of software,
but one of the ugliest I've ever seen (even I can do a better web interface...)
and quite obscure to configure. But the numbers of cameras it can handle and the
capabilities to control the camera is very very powerful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="events-and-actions">
<h2>Events and actions</h2>
<p>No home automation system would be complete without an events and rules system.
In Domoticz, you have several ways to create rules.</p>
<p>The first solution is to create group. A group is simply a set of switches that
are all activated together. This is pretty limited, but can be useful. The
second solution is a scene. A scene is activated by a device and can set several
switches to on or off after the activation. The problem with this is that you
have to listen for an action as activation, you cannot use an existing device or
a rule with a value. For me, these two possibilities are way too limited and
I don't really a reason to use them.</p>
<p>The best solution is to script an handler. For that, there are two ways, either
you define visually your script with blocky, for instance:</p>
<img alt="Domoticz Blockly Rule" class="align-center" src="images/domoticz_blockly.png"><p>This seemed so cool that I wanted to do all my rules with that. Unfortunately,
it is really limited. The main limitation is that you cannot nest if blocks. In
fact the interface lets you do, but it doesn't work afterwards. The other
limitation is that it has no notion of time. For instance, it's very hard to
create an action if a computer is shutdown for more than 60 seconds. You can do
it, but you end up creating virtual devices which are turned off after some
delay and it gets really complicated really soon...</p>
<p>In the end, I used Lua script directly. These scripts have the information about
the last values of each device and the last updated time as well. It's much
easier with that to create powerful rules especially when you want a notion of
time. There are plenty of examples on the Domoticz forum about very powerful
rules that you can create. Unfortunately, there are some limitations. For
instance, you cannot send several actions to the same device in the same script
Moreover, you also have to decode the values of the sensors yourself. For
instance, for a temperature and humidity sensor, you'll have to parse the values
and extract the one you need by hand.</p>
<p>So far, I haven't created many rules, only four. The first rule is that with the
push of one remote button I can power on my smart socket and turn on one of my
computers in my office. Then, if both the computers on this smart sockets have
been off for more than 60 seconds, the power is shut off on the smart socket.
And I have done almost the same for my media center and TV in my living room.</p>
<p>In the future, I'll probably only use the Lua scripting capability. In my
opinion, it's better to have all the scripts in the same language for
maintainability reasons. Once my futures devices arrive, I'll have a few more
rules to code.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To wrap up, I'd say that I'm pretty satisfied with my new home automation system
with Domoticz. It's not a perfect tool, but it has a lot of features and is
working quite well in general. I would recommend you to try it if you want
a good home automation system, fully featured and relatively easy to use.</p>
<p>I've several more things planned for this system. I plan to test a real motion
sensor rather than rely only on the cameras which are focused on the doors and
windows. I also plan to add an outdoor temperature sensor. And more
interestingly, I'm going to try to integrate smart bulbs from Milight to be able
to control my lights from the system. These are the shot term projects that
I want to do, but I have many more ideas!</p>
<p>I'm also sure that there are some features from Domoticz that I have overlooked
or not discovered.</p>
<p>I'll probably write more posts on Home Automation on the coming months.</p>
